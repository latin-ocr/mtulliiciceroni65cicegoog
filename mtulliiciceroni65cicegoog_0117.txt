Bywater (Journal of Philology vn p. 76 foll.) shows that the sub
stanes of this section is probably derived from Aristode through Cleanthes
and Posidonius ‘The psychica] and cosmica] causes, the lst and 4th
in Cleanthes¹ series', are stated by Sext. Emp. rx 20 to have been also
alleged by Aristotle (in the dialogue de philosophia, as is generally sup·
posed), as the grounds of religious belief. ‘Iu such abnormal psychica]
phenomena as dream, ecstasy, enthusiasm, the second-sight with which
we eredit the dying (the phenomena, in short, on which, according to the
ancient distinction, natural as opposed to artificial divination was based)
Aristotle found an explanation of the way in which the mind comes to
divine, or have a presentiment of, the existence of other minds greater and
mightier than anything human'. Sextus (ibid 21 and 26) goes on to
describe the effect of the contemplation of the ordered movements of the
sun and stars on the mind of the observet. He gives this very succinctly,
but Bywater from acomparison of other writers, makes it probable that ·
in the original dialogue the two causes were connected in some such ’
way as follows: ‘the presentiment, originating in the core of our inner
psychical experience, acquires a new force and impert, assoon as we reflect
on the facts of the universe outside us; we seem introduced into a temple,
like that at Eleusis, only more august and solemn, because the figures (the
heavenly bodies), which we see circling around us, are not lifeless or made
with hands, and the celebrante are not men, but the immortal gods¹.
Compare several passages in this book, in which the universe is compared
to a palene or mansion, βξ 15,17‚ above all § 95. We must take cereto
distinguish the historica] question, how man arrived at the idea of God, of .
which Cleanthes here treats, from the philosophical question, what is the
validity of that idea. Sextus in like manner treats separately of the two,
discussing the former, πῶς ol πρότερον νόησιν θεῶν ἔσχον, in §§ 14-47, the
latter, εἷ εἶσὶ θεοί, in the sections which follow. Lucretius deals with thc
former v nel-1240. In ξ 15 eie. seems to be rather trenching on the
philosophical ground.

eam quae orta esset: in this and the following clause (qnam ceperi-
mus) Cic. carelessly prcdicates of coena what should have been predicated of
iwrio. It is only in regard to the 4th that he extricates himself from the
confusion (qaenam esee oeqaabditcnem). Observa the change of tense, qaae
orta earet—qnam ceperimus-quae terreret. The lst is regarded as a single
act antecedent to the action of the principa] verb, the 3rd is continuous,
