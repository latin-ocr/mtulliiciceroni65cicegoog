THE GOSPEL ACCORDING TO ST MARK. By the Rev.
G. F. Maenalia, D.D. With 3 Maps. 4s. 6d.

“The Cambridge Greek Testament, of which Dr Maclear’s edition of the Gospel accordin to
St Mark isa volume, certainly supplies a want. Without pretending to compete with the learTng
commentaries, or to embody very much original research, rt forms a most satisfactory introduction
to the study of the N ew Testament in the original. . . Dr Maclear's introduction contains all that
is known of St Mark’s life, with references to passages in the New Testament in which heis
mentioned: an account of the circumstances in which the Gospel was composed, with an estimate
of the influence of St Peter’s reaching upon St Mark: an excellent sketch of the special character·

y istics of this Gospel; an analysis, and a chapter on the text of the New Testament generally . . .

“The Notes‚ which are admirably put together, seem to contain all that is necessary for the “

guidance of the student, as well as a jndicious selection of passages from various sources illustrat·
