that the rei is to the heaven itself aud not to the heavenly bodies, but
bothero alike ethered, only that the latter are a concentrated form of ether.
For the substantiva] use of caelestia of. Cato 77 coelestiam ordinem contem·
plantes, roeo. v 8 caedentium diuino cognitio

voluerunt: those who elothed the truth in the form of fable meant
that that highest all-creative clement of ether or lire, of which the
heavenly bodies are composed, was complete in itself and needed no other
aid

oh. xxv χρόνοςε the first suggestion of this untenable etymology is
found in Eurip. Hercei. 900 Αἰῶν Κρόνου παῖς. It appears in Cornutus e. 2,
Heracl. Aa. p. 465, Macrob. Sat. 18, Varro ap. Aug. 0. D. v11 19.

Saturnus quod saturaretur annis: it is curious that a similar deriva-
tion was given for Κρόνος, see Plat. θνατοί. 396 Κόρον νοῦ, Lydus Meas. p. 26
Κρόνον europe νοῦν οἱονεὶ πλήρη καὶ μεστὸν ἐτῶν, ἀντὶ τοῦ μακραίωνα. Varro
(L. I. v 64 and Aac. ΠΙ) gives the more correct etymology, ab sato eet
ducos. The older form is coetaneos. For the Mood of. ξ 68 Diana dicta
quio efficere and Roby Gr. ξ 1744.

natos comesse fingitur: Flaek p. 63 cites Greek authorities for the
interpretation given, which he traces back to Zone. Preller’s explanation
is that the summer heat, while it ripens the fruit, also burns up the plant.
For the form cf. esce in §7. .

insaturabiliter: the adv. appears to be ἅπ. λεγ., the adj. isiound
decr. 110.

vinctus a Jove: Hes, Theop. 718, Plato Ewbyphr. 5 n.

ne haberet atoue ut eum alligaret=ae Ιιοόονοο sed ridaeic caraem
coerceretur. Time is limited by the sidereal movements. For the change
of Subject cf. § 36 n. and Wopkens Lect. Teo. p. 264 cited by Sch

juvans parer: Ennius gave this derivation in his Epr'clearraor fr. 7,
brec est errpicea qoem dico, quem Graeci cocant ceream qai reatos eet ec
acta, irater postca, atque ea imbre frigus ; cauce post fit, aer denuo. Hacoce
propter Jappirer som ieta quae dico ribi (they are called by the name
Juppiter) qnoniam mortales atque orbes beluasque ornnes jacar. Varro in
citing this gives a better etymology oiim Davo et Diespiter drocas, id eet
dierpcrer, L. L. v 66. Gellius v 12 follows Ennius.

conversis casibus: ‘by a change of inflexions', not, Iehjnk, ‘in the
oblique cases, as being the cases which undergo change of form' (L. and S.
aiter Seu), nor as Lesoal. ‘in the heteroclite oases'. oio. uses coeca in
Orat. II 358 where he describes a mnemonic system in which the word to
be remembered is suggested by on'e slightly differing‚ similium cadmum
coracem et immorata caribus νιοιοίόο, Harena. Iv 31 carie lac cnam acmen
ia ennoematicae caecam oolmctom est (the name Menander has just been
used in the N om. Gen. Dat. dre.); Orator 1 60 ocsus rectas. Varro opposes
obliqui (πτῶσις πλαγία of the Greeks) to rectos L. L. VIII 46, 49 dvc.

Aristotle uses πτῶσις in a wider sense of any sort of inflexion including
the Adverb, but excluding the Nona from which it declines or falls away
