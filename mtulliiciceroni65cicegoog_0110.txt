⁷ Etruscos haruspices, si criminamini, 1111111111· Erroriaqne principes oloc-

trinam doceto. We often read 01 1111111111 summoned from Etruria in
order to avert calamities threatened by prodigies, eg, 3 Oct. 19, Liv.

in P. Scipione: ‘in the case 01 Scipio'. Bouhier added in, which
might easily be lost after the preceding 11, and which appears to me to
give a better sense than the simple date, P. Cornelius Scipio Nasica,

. 'surnamed Corculum from his wisdom and especially from his knowledge

of law, was elected consul with O. Marcius Figulus in 162111, ’ He was
also censor and pontifex maximus. He married his second cousin, the
daughter of Scip. Afric. Maj, and was thus connected with Gracchus.
ri. Sempronius Gracchus: consul in no. 177 and 163 (iterum), censor
in 110. 169, married a daughter of Scip. Afric. Maj. and was father 01 the
two famous tribunes, with whom he is favourably contrasted by Ο.Ὶ (Off. 11
43), and 01 a daughter who married Scip. Afr. Mi. He gained a triumph
over the Celtibericus and Sardinians Perhaps the experience here related
may have given him more respect 101 the haruspices, as O. tells a story 01
his consulting them about two snakes, which hed found their way into his
house (Dic. 136). <
crearet: used sometimes 01 the assembly,asLe9. 1119, 10 plebs 01111
1111111101, Liv. xxlv 8 §§ 9 and 15, or even 01 the vote 01 one tribe, as
Lir. v 18, xxrv 9 praerogativa creont; sometimes of the presiding ma
gistrate who announces the result of the voting, Lep. 111 9 patracen re
prodente qni 0111111111 creare 1011111111 1111 possint, Ati. rx 9 where O. finds
fault with Caesare proposal that the praetor should preside at the election
01 consuls, 1101 1111111 in libris 1111111111 non rnodo 10111111 n praetore, reri ne

rogando 00111901 He might even stop the election and recommend a
different choico, Liv. 121, xxrv 8, where Fabius ends his speech with the
words praeca revoca (tribum) ; or he might allow another to speak against
the apparent choice before the formal renuntiatio Liv. v 18, xxvr 22.
rogator: as the word rope is the technical term 101 taking the votes 01
’ the assembly (e. g. in Liv. xx11 35 and Art. 11 9 quoted above), 10 reparer
was used in old Latin 101 the presiding officer (cf. Lucil. Sui. 27 consilinm Ι
poenire 1191119111 minorica rogator), especially in the fuller phrase corni
tiorum rogator used below. its more common sense however, when used
alone or (as in Dic. 11 75) with centurionis that 01 pelling-clerk, as here
and p. red. in 1111. 28, where O. asks, in reference to the enthusiasm shown
about his recall from exile, ‘when did any one see men 01 such distinction ¹
acting as 1091110111 diribitores aristocles?
