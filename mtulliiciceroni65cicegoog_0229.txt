ρνίαραν. Of. also Lucr. vr 423 foll. where the πρηστῆρ is described, esp.

this is called (l. 438) versabundus tarto, see Munro in loc.

nisi ques terrestres strages: ‘unless (=or it may be) the sea is pre·
paring devastation for the land ’.

evertens specus—eruit: ‘upheaving the caverns from⁴ under their
roots in the depths cf the stormy sea, throws up the stony mass to the
light of heaven ². The old edd. of Priscian give coma, which Dav. prefers,
as Longinus (saal. 3) has notieed the phrase πρὸς οὐρανὸν ἐξεμεῖν, but, ss
Heind. has pointed out, it would be extremely incongruens here, as spoken
of Triton ; and, in point of fact, three of Keil’s four nss give erait and the
fourth meruit.

quem cernit ignotam: by a sort of attraction the epithet of the Subject
of the principal clause (ignota actara) is attached to the Object of the
subordinate clause ; and is thus made mors prominent, ‘which he sees
without knowing it’3 cf. Vere. 1v 27 casa qaae patetaetma apud eam
cedant. See for the converse attraction (Subject of subordinate changed
into Object of principal clause) 1 13 n.

juvenibus visis: [The spectator catches sight of the rowers bending

forwards and backwards, and the oars flashing and splashing in the sea.
At first it reminds him of a school of dolphins with their quick movements

and dashes of spray : afterwards he recognizes that they are jaeeaea. R.]
From the following explanation of the simile ( priam aspecta inanimam,
post inape suspicaret we should have expected javeaibae to be fol·
lowed by a more distinct explanation of the real nature of the ship.
The same opposition is suggested by the detta primo here; it is taken
up by adeatque, where danae would perhaps have been more natural, but ’
possibly the Greek wast δὲ αὐτόν, implying the inconsistency of the two
views. In all probability the original gave along quotation, describing
how the spectator gradually awoke to a right appreciation of the fact
before him, which C. has cut down with his itera alia malta.
