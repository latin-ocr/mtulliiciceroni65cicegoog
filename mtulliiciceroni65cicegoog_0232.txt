v 565, Cleomedes 11 1. His true diameter is 882,000 miles, ie. more than
111 times that of the earth (Herschel §358). For the riews of other ancient
astronomers cf. Aeaci. 1182 (solem) mathematici amplias duodeviginti partibus
confirmant majorem esse qaam terram ; Macrob. S. Sc. 120 Eratosthenes ιἰι

massuram solet efficit. Poadloaias atat malta multoque saepias mrdtiplicatam
solea asiaticae efficere. Cleomedes professes to give the calculations of the
latter. In 1 ο. 10 p. 52 we have his calculation of the circumference of the
earth from the length of the are between Rhodes and Alexandria, which he
finds from observation of the elevation of the star Canopus to be ἡ of the
circle. The length of this arc is taken as 5000 stades; hence the earth’s
circumference will be 240,000 stades and its diameter 30,000 stades.
Again in Bk 11 l p. 79 we find the words ὑποθέμενος μυριοπλοσίονα εἶναι
τὸν ἡλιακὸν κύκλον τοῦ τῆς γῆς κύκλου, ἀπὸ τούτου ὁρμῶμενοο δείκνυσιν ὅτι
μυριάδων τριακοσίων εἶναι δεῖ τὴν τοῦ ἡλίου διάμετρον, which Delambre
paraphrases as follows (1225), ‘Posidonius calcula que le diametra du Soleil
doit etre de 300 myriades de stades et que ce diametra est au moins 10,000
fois aussi grand que celui de la terre'. But we have seen that the earth's
diameter was calculated by Posidonius at 80,000 stades, therefore the Sun's
(liameter should be, notabo myriads (3,000,000), but 30,000 myriads
(800,000,000> of stades. Delambre would have been saved from falling
into a gross blunder if he had noticed that immediately below (pp. 81, 83)
the phrase ἡλιακὰς κύκλος manifestly refers, 11οο οο the circumference, but
to the orbit of the Sun. Itis there stated that the Sun's diameter is
,βω of his orbit (Archimedes makes it siff). According to this proportion
the Sun's orbit should be 75οκ3,000,000 οοοάοοε2,250,000,000, which is ,
11οο so far from 10,000 times the supposed circumference of the earth. It
would appear therefore that Posidonius made the Sun's diameter 37} times
larger than that of the earth. Cleomedes had heard (φοσθ 011οο Hipparchus
made it 1050 times that of the earth. “

reliqua sidera: Cleomedes (11 3p. 961011), who mostly follows Posi-

donius, argues that many of the fixed stara must be as large or eren
larger than the sun.
