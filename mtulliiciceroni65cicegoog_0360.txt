“Mr Willis-Bund has edited ‘A Selection of
Cases frorn the State Trials' which is likel to
form a very valuable addition to the stan d
literature.. . There can be no doubt, therefore,
, of the interest that can be found in the State
trlals. But the are large and unwieldy, and it

is in t e first volume reduce to a commodioris

“This work is a very useful contribution to

“This is a wbrk of such obvious utility that
the only wonder is that no one should have un·

abridged, this is for the ordinary student’s pur·

‘⁸ But, although the book is most interesting
to the historiari of constitutional law, it is also
not without considerable value to those who
seek information with regard to procedure and
the growth of the law of evidence. We should
¹add that Mr Willis-Bund has given short re·
faces and a perdices to the trials, so as to fdrm
a connecte narrative of the events in history
to which they relate. We can thoroughly re·
‘commend the orout-saw Times.

’ “To a large class of readers Mr Willis·
Bund's compilation will thus be of great as·

sistance, for e presents in a convenient form a

judicious selection of the principal statutes and
the leading cases bearin onrhe crime of trea-
son . . . F or all classes of readers these volumes
possess an indirect interest, arising from the
nature of the cases themselves, from the men
who were actors in them, and frorn the numerous
points of social life which are incidentally illus·
trated in the course of the trials. On these
features we bevenot dwelt, but have preferred
to show that the book is avaluable contribution
to the study of the sub‘ect with which ir pto·
fesses to deal, namely, e history uf the lew ef
treason.''-A thermum
