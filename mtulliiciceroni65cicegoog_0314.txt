records ingrateful terms the special providences of his own life (1 17),
will not allow that even the more general view of Providence is incom-
patible with religione hope (VI 44) εἰ δέ μὴ ἐβουλεύσαντο κατ’ ίδίαν περ1 ἐμοῦ,

contrahere universitatem generis humani: ‘we may narrow the
scope of our argument in regard to humanity at large', lit. ‘we may bring
within a narrower compass the whole (ie. what affecte the whole) of man·

magnam quandam insulam: cf. a. P. VI 21 οιααιζς enim terra qaae
colitur α cobis acpasta amicam (ie. in longitude), ceream latior (i. e. iu
latitude)‚ parca quaedam iccata est, circumfusa iao mari, quod Atlantieam,
qaod mapsam, qaem Oceanum appellatio. The idea was first started by
Plato Pkaedo p. 109 Β, ‘the earth πάμμεγά τι εἶναι, κα1 ἡμεῖς οἰκεῖν, τοὺς
μέχρι Ἡρακλείων στηλῶν ἀπὸ Φάσιδος, ,ἐν σμικρῷ τινι μορίῳ, καὶ ἄλλους ἄλλοθι
πολλοὺς ἐν πολλοῖς τοιούτοις τόποις οἰκεῖν '. In the pseudo-Aristotelian dc
Μανιοίο the theory is much more developed3 thus in 3 §2 we read ἡ σύμ· ·

διαιρεῖται δὲ είς τε Εὖροίπην καί Ἀσίαν καὶ Λιβύηντ 11). § 3 ‘it is probable
that there are many other continents washed by other sees ². cleomedes
(1 2), no doubt following Posidonius, says ‘there are four οἰκουμένοι in the
earth, two in the northern temperate zone and two in the southern ; those
who live in that which is opposite to ours, in the northern hemisphere, are
called our περίοικοι, those who are diametrioally opposite to us are the
ἀντίποδες, those who lie directly to the south of us are the ἅντοικοι. Their
existence is probeble from reason, but not demonstrated by scienoe'. See

[Rhodum ¹: the collocation of this by the side of Rome, Athens and
Sparta is noticeable. Rhodes was famous and resembled Athens in three
ways, (l) as having a free constitution, cf. a. P. 147 ia libero actem papale,
at accat at Attecc's, ib. 111 48, (2) as a great naval power, Marcii. 54 coa

Panaetius wasa native of Rhodes, and Posidonius long resided there as
head of the Stoic school. R]
