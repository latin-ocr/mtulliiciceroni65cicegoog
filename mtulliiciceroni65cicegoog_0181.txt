older philosophare (1) 11161 the fixed stsrs were 16616661 like nails in a
solid heaven or sphere aud of course revolved with it, 11111111 δίκην καταπεπη-
γὲναι τῷ κρυσταλλοειδεῖ, as ia said of Anaximenes Piae. Ptit. Π 14, and
Empedocles, ib. 133 Anaximander, Pythagoras aud Parmenides preferred
to speak 61 1116 61616 being attached to spheres: (2) that they vvere light
bodies borne along by αἰθέριος taos (Arist. Nat. 379); so Xenophanes,
Heraclitus, Anaxagoras, Democritus. Aristotle took 1116 former view
λείπεται τοὺς μὲν κύκλους κινεῖσθαι, τὰ δὲ ἄστρα ἠρεμεῖν καὶ ἐνδεδεμίνα τοῖς
κύκλοις κινεῖσθαι Cael. 11 8 ; in Met. x11 71611 11666611161616611 spherae, in
addition to that of the fixed 61616, which were required to explain the
movements of the sun, moon and planeta, both the stars and the spheres

would 66616 that Balbus here condemns both explanatione, and would
attribute the movement 61 the 1111611 61616, as well as of the planete, to
their own free will: so Manutius ap. Lescalop. (not in Var. ed) 6696111
Stoici 1161161 aetheri (rather 61 aethere 66166) 1166 caelo affiatu 6116611611
6616166166 661 esse opinanter et mota voluntario ferri aetherius eureus
will not then mean ‘the pathos the stare through the ether ', 161· this the
Stoice admitted, see below ξ 117 ia 66111616 aetra volventem but ‘a move-
ment caused by ether’, going by 611161, as we talk 61 going by steam3 61
below 1166 cet 66116111 66 661616 at contorqueat, and, 161 the expression,
66611 phrases as 111616 61166116, 6666116 worked by an ass or by water.
The argument however is not very clear: two theorias having been put

Stoio view differ 61161 all from that of Aristotlei All that is 111616 asserted
is that the motion 61 the sphere is independent 61 the surrounding ether,
but that is admitted by Arist. 61 all events in 1116 case 61 the planetary
spheres. One expects the assertion that 66611 fixed star moves iude
pendently and yet in such harmony as to give 1116 appearance 616 great

motion (Stob. Ect. 1 446 ἐν τῷ α16ἔρ1 vd ἄστρα καθίδρυται, and shortly aiter-
