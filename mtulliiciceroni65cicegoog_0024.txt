difficulty in refuting the rather wild suggestion that the ‘rud seotion
is derived from Apollodorus, as being the chief writer on the inter- -
pretation of myths.

My notes show a distinct connexion between this book of the
N. D. and the 9th hook of Sextus Empiricus on the one hand¹ and
the treatises de Prouidentia of Philo and Theodoret ou the other.-
I am not aware whether there has been any careful investigation ol
the sources of these books, but Ι should conclude that they were,
in part at least, taken either from Posidonius directly or from writers
who had copied from him.

¹ Compare particularly the quotation from Xenophon in 5 18 with Sext. rx ,
92, that from Aristotle 5 95 with Sextus xx 20, the comparison of the movements
of the heavenly bodies to the movements of an army or a ship in 55 85, 87, 89,

with Sext. rx 26, 783 and the reference to the orrery in 5 88 with Sextus rx 114.
