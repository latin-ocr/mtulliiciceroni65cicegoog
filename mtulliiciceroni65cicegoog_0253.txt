obductus: can we take this,'with Sch, es equivalent to οάιιονιιιο or
ob'cctcu? The more natural sense would be ‘covered '‚ ‘veiled' (aa below

νον ‘slanting', for which German. and Vitr. (rx 4 ξ 2) have the more cor·
rect bamam.

Oapra: the star called Capra or Capella was supposed to be Amalthea,

tioned than the constellation Auriga, oi which it forms a part, cf. Hor. Od.

placed, or accidentally repeated from above, as they break the connexion
between baec and Caprc; andin the original only two lines are omitted

Phaecam. 290 atqve genu flcco Ταισιιι conubia lagare. When we com-
pare this with the present line, the question arises whether condor may
not express a kneeling posture‚ as we saw that aicae did, both being con·
nected with ραιιιι ,· otherwise we must suppose that 0. here wrongly took
Ταῦρον as Subj. of the Inf. ‘the Bull struggles' (amica), and misunder-
stood πεπτηότα, which here and in l. 354 (of Andromeda in presence of the
-seamonster) we ought probably to connect with αιήσσοε in 1323 (of
Orion) ὑψοῦ πεπτηῶτα, and 317 (four 01010) παρβολάδην δύο πὰρ δύο πεπτη-
ῶτα, some other explanation is required, and 1 should connect it either
with πιτάννυμι or πέτομαι. Grotius gives three censes, (1) ‘expanded',
(2) ‘bowed down', and (3) ‘threatening’ (l). Germanicus here has 000,
