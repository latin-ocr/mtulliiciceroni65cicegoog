- socan cu.xxv1 §66 175

The third syllable is more difficult, because the termination -on (not aba)

in Latin is, when applied 10 personal names and generally, masculine (see
’ ar. §§ 851, 662). But the early poets here come to our help. They
treated Greek feminine substantivas in -ω as having this termination, and
spoke 01 Didonem Calypsonem &a (Gr. § 481), probably suggested by the
accusatives in ν (mr, οῦν) occasionally found (Kiihner Gr. (ir. § 129). R]

Peltunus: pater Portunus in Aea. v 241, the god 01 entranoes and
herbours, ef. Preller p. 158.

Neptunus: Preller p. 502 compares the Etmsoan ‘Nethuns'‚ which he
connects with νόω, νέω, considering that the digammated forms νεύσομοι,
νοῦς show the possibility 01 1 derivative such as Nept.=Nereas. Curtius
and Vanipek agree with Varro L. L. v 71 in connecting it with nabes
(νέφος) qaod mare terras obnubit, at arabes caelum.

01 the air (Cornutus 5, Varro L. L. v 66), in which Seneca believed that
the soul underwent purgatorial discipline before ascending to the ether,

cui Proserpinam nuptam: l think O. wrote thus, intending 1ο make
it dependent onytnpaat; but the construction was broken through the par-
enthesis. The similarity 01 termination would account for the disappear·
anae 01 nuptam. Edd read nuptam dicam before Proserpinam without ns
authority.

Gmeeomm nomen est: Preller (p. 443) and Vanipek agree with Cio.

Prosepiaa, which was naturally altered so as 10 derive it from prosam,

1 67. a gerendis frugibus Ceres: the same derivation appears in
Varro L. L. v 64, apparently after Ennius. The Romans were naturally
led to such an etymology by the fact that the same character (O) was
used indiscriminately for the sharp. and flat guttmaltill the beginning ’
