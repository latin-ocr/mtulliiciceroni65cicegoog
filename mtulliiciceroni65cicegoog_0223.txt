saw a ship moving onwords with soils set; the same inference is suggested
by the orderly movements of the stars ¹. Sextus (ib. 78) mentions a ship
as an en of a body compouuded ἐκ συναπτομένων, an army as an ex. of a
body ἐκ διεστώτων, and contrasts these with the strictly ἡνωμένα such as
φυτὰ καὶ ζῷα.

procreatio vitis : the reference to the plant and animal as exhibiting
lower stages of the divine Reason is found in Sext ib. 116. See above ξ 35
and passages there quoted from 110. rv 32, v 39.

dentes et pubertatem: these were cited as exemplos of the coexist

enee of the lower and higher forms of life in man, cf. Posidonius ap. Diog. v11
138 τὸν κόσμον οἰκεῖσθαι κατὰ νοῦν καῖ πρόνοιαν...εἶς ἅπαν αὐτοῦ μέρος διήκοντος
τοῦ νοῦ, καθάπερ ἐφ’ ἡμῶν τῆςψυχῆς· ἀλλ’ ἤδη δι’ ῶν μέν μᾶλλον, δῖ ῶν δε ἧττον·
δι’ ῶν μὲν γὰρ ῶς ἕξις κεχώρηκεν, ῶς διὰ τῶν ὀστῶν καὶ τῶν νεύρων· δι’ ῶν δὲ ῶς νοῦς,

, ὥς διὰ τοῦ ἡγεμονικοῦ. Cic. however seems rather to misapply the argument:

his argument here seems to be that since life appears in its lower form of
φύσις or ἕξις in parts of the human fremo, therefore man himself is aetu-
ated by-it ought to be-‘this lower life ’; but he says instead ‘ by natm·e'
in its highest Stoic sense. 11 may be questioned however whether he dis·
tinctly realized that φύσις had this lower meaning, though we catch un·
eonscious glimpses of it. For the use of the abstract pubertas instead of
the concrete pubes cf. Plin. N. H. xxr 97.
