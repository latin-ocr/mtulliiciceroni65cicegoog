Boon 11 on. xnn ξ 110. 227

nomine claro: this is quite appropriate here. Arcturus is a famous
and ancient name; as he says of himself in the fladeae (prol.) ιίριιιιιιι
acm omnium acerrimam, vehemens ιιιιιι ecoctam ; οιιιιι oceno, vehementer.

cui subjecta: οιμοιι in uss probably arose from dittographia 'of the
following ιιιο. Dav. end others retain it, inserting pedibas and so giving a
closer rendering of the Gr. (196) ἀμφοτέροισι δέ ποσσίν ὕπο σκέψαιο Βοώτεω
Παρθένον, ἤ ῥ’ έν χειρὶ φέρει σταχὺν αἰγλήεντα. Heind3objects to Dav.'s
reading on the ground that itis unsuited to the immediate antecedent
Arcturus. '

epicum: this word is found in all three gandera. The neuter is at
tested in this place by Servius on (leo. 1 111, ο1. Varro ap. Non p. 225
nepae ιἰι borea segete ιιιιίίιιιιι eat spicam aequem, seqare ιἰι mala ιιοιι aliquod
οοιιιιιιι. Voss conjectures the meaning of the ear of corn to be that the
harvest commenced under that sign.

virgo: Aratus describes her at length in words borrowed from Hesiod's
description of Justioe (Op. 192, 257 ἦ δέ τε παρθένοι ἐστὶ Δίκη Διὸς ἐκγεγαυῖα
foll), cf. V. Geo. 11474 ostreata per illos latreia excedens terris ιιιιιιζρία
lipari. Ovid (Met. 1 150) and Seneca (Ocrea. 423 neglecto ιιιται sapit el
atores seros, οοιιιίιιιιιιι caesaraeae pollutae ιιιαιιιιι, Astraea αι’τρο scelerum
mapsam decas) call her Astraea, others supposed her to be Erigone or
Ceres Virgil (nez. 1v 6) makes her return in the now age of gold.

Oh. xn111. dein quae sequuntur: transferred from above, seen. on
Ιιιιιό Booti: the phrase seems to imply impatience,a disposition to hurry
on, and would be very suitable here, as 47 linos of the Greek are omitted,
in which Aratus tells the story of Astraea. '

et natos Geminos invises: Aratus 147 κρατὶ δὲ οἱ Δίδυμοι, μέσση θ’
ὕπο Καρκίνος ε’στί· ’ποσσὶ δ’ ὑπ’ ἀμφοτέροισι Λέων ὑπὸ καλὰ φαείνει. The
Twins were usually identified with Castor and Pollux, sometimes with
Amphion and Zethus, or, ογ Nigidius, with the Samothraciam gods.

Cancer: said to have been placed in heaven by Juno for aiding the
Hydra in its conflict with Hercules (of. the story of Orion). Some thought
it was selected to mark the summer solstice because after that the Sun
moves backwards (Macrob. 1 17 § 63).

Leo: the Sun enters this sign in the middle of J uly, hence it is called
by Hor. cd. 1v 29 19 stella vesani Mollis. It was identified with the
Nemean lion, which was said to be of lunar origin and to have been sent
down to earth by luno. Probably it is a mere symbol of the violent heat
of the Sun at that time.

latiens: referring to the twinkling of the star, as in Ptoeaom. 51
ιιιιοίιοονο jacit ριιαιίιιιι ι corpore tamea, and below ξ 111 Eques ηιιαιιοιιι
jubam.

andra: Aratus goes on after some ten lines (l. 160) αὐτὸν (Ἡνίοχοι)
μέν μιν ἅπαντα μέγαν Διδύμων εἰιί λαιᾷ κεκλιμένον δήεις· Ἑλίκης δέ οἱ ἅκρα
κάρηνα α’ντιά δινεύει· excip δ’ έπεληλαται ὤμῳ αἲξ ίερη’. The chariotecr was
identified with Erichthonius (cf.Virg.0.111 113 pamas neamalis αιτιοι
