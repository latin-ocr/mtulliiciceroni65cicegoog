Divine being and on the other the beauty of the externel universe ε and so
here, the cave-dwellers are supposed to have an original belief in (iod,
which is afterwards confirmed by the wonders of nature. On the Dialogus

subterra: probably suggested by the famous simile in Plain's nep. v1,

perhaps also by traditione of Troglodytas. So Porphyry, in his ele Antra
Nympharum, treats Hemesa grotta of the nymphs, ἄντρον ἐπήρατον ἠεροειδὲς
ἱρὸν Νυμφάων (001. x111 103 foll), as an allegory of the world: διὰ μὲν οὖν

however it is better 10 take it as an Abl. cf Attendant Circumstanees.
