does not make it quite clear how the doctrine of the upward movement of
air and lire 10 10 be reconciled with the belief in universal gravitation : ‘it
is correctly said that all the parts of the world, especially those that have
weight, seek the centro, and that thiais the cause of the stability 0111101101-
versa and os the earam air and fia are absolutely without weight, suu they
have a sort of tendency to the centro of the universal sphera, though they
naturally gether around its circumference' (γίγνεσθαι ταῦτά πως ἐπὶ τὸ τῆς
όλης σφαίρας τοῦ κόσμου μέσον, τὴν bi σύστασιν πρὸς τὴν περιφέρειαν αὐτοῦ ·
ποιεῖσθαι). Compare also passages cited by Zeller 11 pp. 184, 185. The
explanation seems to be that the all-pervading ether, while it has a na
turally expansive and inter-penetrativa force, has aleo a strong oohesive
force and thus holds all things together around the centre. See below,
on the air, which has in 110011 a tendency te 1100, and yet clinga to the
clement immediately under it, so as to forbid any vacuum ; and cf. Plut.
