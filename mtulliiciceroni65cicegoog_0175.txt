up the number seven, as in ξ 68 septem vagantibus and Cleomedon 1 3 τὰ δὲ

progressus et regressus: ‘direct and retrograde motione ', cf. Hersohol
Astron. oh. 1x ξ 457 foll. ‘the apparent movernents of the planets are much
more irregular than those of the sun or moon....Sometimes they advance

rapidly, then relax in their apparent speed‚ come toa momentary stop, ,
and then actually reverse their former motione, and run back upon their

former course with a rapidity at first increasing,⁴then diminishing, till the
retrograde movement ceases altogether. Another statice, or moment of
apparent rest, now takes place3 after which the movement is again reversed
and resumes its original direction. On the whole however the amount of
direct motion more than compensates the retrograde; and by the excess
of the former over the latter, the gradual advance of the planet from west
to east is maintained '. Itis then shown by diagrams that this irregu-
larity arises partly from these evolutione being seen bya spectator from
the earth in section‚ and therefore foreshortened, and partly from the fact
that the earth is being carried round the sun on her own orbit at a different
rate from that of the planet under observation. See below ξ 103, Parc. 1 62,
