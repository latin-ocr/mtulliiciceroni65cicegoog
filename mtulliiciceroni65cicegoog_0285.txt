by Eu'rip. El. 828, Plato qam 71 o, Arist Η. A. 171, vn 8.) In the liver
the chyle is further purified by depositing certain secretione; that which
islight and yellow is drawn off to the gall bladder, that which is heavy
and thick is carried to the spleen by a vein connecting it with the portae.
The blood thus purified is then passed into the cena cova where it gete rid
of its superfluous watery particles through the kidneys adjoining. Thus
the liver ie τὸ πρῶτον τῆς αἱματώσεως ὄργανον (c. 12). The numerous veins
which convey the chyle to the liver all unite into a single trunk at the
portae and then again subdivide into a vast number of small veins in order
to imbibe the substance of the liver and so thoroughly clarify the blood
(see Ideler Phys. Mire. vol 11 p. 6). This was the generally accepted theory
among the audente, aewe may see from TheodoretPreo. p. 517 Schulze, ‘the
liver having received the chyle from the etomaoh proceeds to pass it
through further strainers, the dregs being drawn off by the spleen, that
which is overdone (τὸ πέρα τοῦ με’τρου πεφθέν) being drawn off into the gall
bladder, and that which is too thin into the receptacle for the watery
secretione. When the chyle has in this way been turned into pure blood
it enters into the verra ccco and is carried by it to the heart'.

quae pertinent ad jecur: but these eice (‘channels ', used in the
same general way as πόροι by Arist.) do not really extend to the liver 3 they
unite, as before said, in the cerro portae and then divide again.

eliae pertinentes: the cerenicus ad praem is required with the word
pertractandam are probably right in inserting clio with Heind but,
in the general doubtfulness as to what O.'s ideas on the subject were, it is
difficult to speak with confidence as to the particular reading required.
We should have expected to hear something of the distribution of the
chyle through the liver itself, but are only told of its arrival at the portae
and then of its being carried off elsewhere. Oomparing the account taken
from Galen above, we might suppose the eice to signify certain ducta by
which the secretione are carried to the gall bladder and the spleen; but O.'s
words seem to imply that he is still following the comse of the main stream
cf the chyle, which he apparently imagines to visit successively the liver,
the spleen and the kidneys, depositing in each the ingredient which belongs
to it, yellow and black bile and saum, the principle of urine (see quotations

y from Galen in next note), and thence returning to the portae and dis·

charging itself into the verra cccc. The true account seems to be as
follows ε the blood in the oeae portae receives an accession from the spleen
through the splenio vein, but does not part with any of its own ingrediente
either to the spleen or to the kidneys until it has passed through the
heart and returned es arteria] blood, from which the secretione are made.
ln its passage through the liver it secretas bile and extracta placore. The
liver itself is not an excretory orgen.

bilis iique umores qui e renibus profunduntur: cf. Galen Ue.
Part. v 10 τὸ δὲ ἧπαρ ὑπὸ τῶν τεττάρων ὀργάνωνέκκαθαίρεται, δυοῖν μὲν νεφροῖν,
τρίτου δὲ σπληνός, τετάρτου δὲ τῆς ἐπικειμένης αὐτῷ κύστεως (the bile duct), ib.
