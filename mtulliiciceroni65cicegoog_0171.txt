particular movements of the planete, is brought out clearly in Plato rim. 34

foll thus summed up by h Butler: ‘Pl first presente us with two vast ⁸

spheres which embody the principles of Same and Different (ταύτὸν καὶ
θότερον). The outer sphere includes the innumerable multitude of the
fixed stara : the inner sphere is subsequently divided by the divine Artist
into seven spheres, which revolve with various velocities‚ and in various
directions'. Eudoxus resolved the complex apparent movements of the
planete into the simple circular movements of several supporting spherae,

the double movement by the comparison of people cn board ship walking
in a direction opposite to that 1n which the vessel was going, or to an ant -
going round the potter's wheel 1n a direction opposite to that of its
movement The apparent daily movement of the outer sphera from east
to west in the plane of the aquator, is ef course due to the daily rotation of ο

their varying rates of motion and occasionel pauses.

same stadium or racc-course (cf. Virg. θ. Ι 513, Aera v 316), via the
zodiac. If we distinguish between spatiis and cursibus, the former would
be the broad band in which all the movements take place, the latter the

out the argument, which should be ‘we' gather from the observation both of
planeta and fired stare that circular moramentis the law of the heavenly
bodies, and this movement requires a spherical shape, therefore they are
all spheres’.

volubilitas: ‘rotatory movement’, cf. 118. rotundi ambitus:
‘circular revolutione ’.
