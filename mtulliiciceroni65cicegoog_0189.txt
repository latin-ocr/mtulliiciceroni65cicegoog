always spoken 01 in the highest terms by Cic, who is followed by Horace
(Od. 1 37) and Juvenal (xr 91), but charged with ambition and corruption
by Sallust. The authority which he exercised is shown bya striking
anecdota. Being accused by the tribune, Varius, 01 exciting the ellies to
revolt, he deigned no other reply than Q. 1011111 Hispanas Μ. 1100010111

Atilius Calatinus triumphed over the Carthaginians in the first
Punic War. Cic. refers to him as 111 example 01 ancient virtue below
§ 165, 111101 13, 110, Cato 61 (where his epitaph is given, 1000 acam

Plana 60. 11010011(109.1128)11111110 dedicated a temple 10 Spes, and
hence Lambinus followed by Heind. reads Spes instead 01 the 21111 Fides,
because Spes, which is mentioned in 111 61 (but 1101 below ξ 79) ought not
to be omitted here, and because Numa was the first builder of the temple 01
Fae. Dav. defends the text, on the ground that 91011010 and 01111 must
refer to the same.

consecrata: this verb means first ‘to hallow', then ‘to deify', as in
11139 0111110 901101 1111101011 Aegyptii careaco-aceram. Like dedico (lit. ‘to
devote ²) it is used both 01 persons and 01 things, 01. below 79 1111111,

Virtutis: there were two temples at Rome 10 110001 and 111101 00111-
bined; one near the 90110 Capena, dedicated originally to Ηο1101 by
Fabius Cunctator rac. 233, in consequence 011 victory over the Liguriaus:
this was afterwards enlarged byMarcellus ‘the sword 01 Rome ’, and ‘dedi-
cated to the two divinities to whom his life was consecrated' (Mommsen).
He had vowed it first in the battle at Clastidium nc. 222, where he won
theopaldo opima by slaying the Gallie king, anda second time during the
siege 01 Syracuse. The temple was finally dedicated by his son 205 nc.
and adorned with treasures of art from Syracuse (1011. 11 121, 123, Liv.
xxv11 25, xm 11): among other things we read of the sphere of Ar-
chimedes being placed there (11. Ρ. 1 14). The second temple was erected
by Marius on the Capitol in commemoration of his victories over the Cimbri
and Teutone (Sext. 116 with Halm’s n, Burn p. 193, Preller p. 613). Later
aseparate temple was built to 1111111 by Scipio the Younger, and one 10
Hortos, mentioned 119. 11 58.

multis: as only eleven years intervened between the dedication by
Fabius and the 1011 01 Clastidium, and only twenty-eight years between
the earlier and 11101 dedication, and as Fabius and Marcellus were too well
known 101 C. to have forgotten that they were contemporaries, we ought
perhaps 10 alter the reading of the Mss by the insertion 011110 negative.

Opis: wife 01 Saturnus and goddess 01 the earth, identified in later
