messa: this hardly gives the αἰνὸν ἄγαλμα 01 the original It may
have been suggested by the words used just before of Cassiopeia ἇνιόζειν
ε’πὶ παιδί.

huic Equus ille: 1110100105 ἀλλ’ ἄρα oi καὶ κρατὶ πελωρ ε’πελήλσται
Ἵππος γαστέρι νειαίρῃ, ξυνὸς δ’ ἐπιλάμπεται ἀστήρ, τοῦ μὲν ἐπ’ ὄμφαλίιρ, τῆς δ’
iaxartem καρήνῳ. The horse is Pegasus who with his hoof made Hippo
crene. For duplices Sch cites V. Aa. 1 93 duplices ad sidera ρα10100, and
Cic. Prov. 00111. 13 tas duplices pestes 1001010111 (01 the consuls Piso and
Gabinius), but both instanoes refer to pairs. Is there any case in which it
means simply ‘two'l Perhaps here we should translate ‘twinned’. 'Phe
line 0010100111 ου estrat-erodere is an embellishment added by O. We find
aedas used 01 a common star in ΡΙιαοαουι. 17 (translating σύνδεσμος), and
00101010 similarly used (l. 34 0010000 aoniae) without anything correspond-
ing 10 11 in the original: the word was also a favourite with Lucretius,
01 his 001000 desim 0010010 amerb, and Munro on v 402, 476, 514.

contortis cum cornibus: ι01111011011100 horns’. Aratus 225 αὐτοῦ
καὶ κριοῖο θοῶταταί εἶσι κέλευθοι. This was supposed to be the ram which
carried Phrixus and Helle. haeret=3rrrjprxrar Aret. 229, regularly used
01 fixed stars, as in Pluzeveom. 169 proed illis Piscibus haereas, where the
Gr. has simply οἶος ἀπὸ προτέρων. For cum see n. on ουνη purgate ἓ 112.

Pisces: after describing Deltoton (the Triangle)‚ Aret. goes on (l. 239)
ἔτι δ’ ἐν προβολῇσι Νότοιο Ἰχθύες, ἀλλ’ αἰεὶ ἕτερος προφερέστερος ἄλλου, καὶ
μᾶλλον Βορέαο νέον κατιόντος ἀκούει. Probably the month in which the sun
passed through this sign was originally connected with fishing. After-
wards a mythological explanation was found in the Syrien deity Derceto or
Atargatis, 01100 1010 01 Venus (Ov. Fert. 11 458), whom the two fishes are
said 10 have saved from Typhon

aqussonis tangitur auris: this method of describing the quarters
01 the heaven is imitated by Lucr. v 689, where see Munro.

Oh. xnrv ξ 112. ad pedes Andromedae: Aratus 248 ἀμφότεροι δὲ
πόδες γαμβροῦ ἐπιοημαίνοιεν Πέρσεος, οἵ ῥα ol αἷέν ἐπωράλιοι φορέονται. Αὐτὰρ
ὁ γ’ ἐν Βορέῳ φέρεται περιμήκετος ἄλλων (11110 feet 01 Andromeda may point
you towards her sponse, 101 they pursuc their path above his shoulder').

cuius propter laevum genu: 11101204ἅγχι δέ οἱ σκαιῆς ἐπιγουνίδος
ἤλιθα πᾶσαι Πληιάδες φορέονται, ὁ δ’ οὐ μάλα πολλὸς ἁπάσας χῶρος ἔχει, καὶ δ’
αὐτοὶ ἐπισκέψασθαι ἀφαυροί. Hipparchus notices that Aratus is wrong in
placing the Pleiads near the knee 01 Taurus; they are really at his back,
near the bright stare in the left 1001 01 Perseus. For the readings see
crit. n. In the Piraeeum. 127 Baehrens reads ot propter lacerem genas
arenis parte 10011100ρο100 Vergilias tenui 0001 lece 01010011, where 1100 have
parvas. The four words following genas are omitted here in three 01
Orelli’s 1100; and Β, which adds them, has 01 instead 01 cujas and geraus
' 101 geas, which certainly suggests that they were inserted from the
Pboeaom. Sch. however and Mu. give the complete lines, making cujas a
monosyllabis, like ejas in ξ 1093 and the former (Opere. 111 336) illustrates
