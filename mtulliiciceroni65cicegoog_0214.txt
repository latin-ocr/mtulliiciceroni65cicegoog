to expressthe ordinary course of nature, and that, in speaking of its being
generated from living principles, he refers to tho periodic regeneration of
the world In the cyolio conflagration the ordinary course of nature is
suspended, the universe retiros into its fiery seed, of which Diog. tells us
(vn 136) θεός ε’στιν ἄφθαρτος καὶ ἀγένητος, δημιουργός όν τῆς διακοσμήσεως,
κατὰ χρόνων ποιός περιόδους ἀναλίσκων εἷς ἔαυτόν τὴν ἅπασαν οὐσίαν καὶ

πάλιν ἐξ ἑαυτοῦ γεννῶν. So we read (Pheo' Phil. 1 7) the Stoice define God
as πῦρ τεχνικὸν όδῷ βαδίζον ε’πί γενέσει κόσμου, ε’μπεριειληφός τε πόντος τοὺς
σπερματικοὺς λόγους, while nature itself is defined as working in aooordance
withthese, ἔστιδὲ φύσις ἕξις ἐξ αὐτῆς κινουμένη κατό σπερματικοὺς λόγους
(Diog. v11 148). Soh. speaks of this clause as being out cf place here, sinos
Providenoe is shown in the government, but not inthe formation of the
world There seems no ground for such alimitation; and as a matter of
fact (l. has aheady divided his subject into these two parts, initio consti-
tntea, omnitempore administrari. Epicurus had taught that the world
was produced by the fortuitous movemenls of dead atoms: Balbus main-

tains in opposition to this that it is due to urtinnntin principie ,· cf. below ¹

more closely : that which is of the nature of soul is, as Plato is so fond of

insisting, essentially prior to thet which is without soul.

argument in the wrong order. We can hardly imputo this to the

carelessness of a scribe, as the words are quoted in the same order by
Laot. 1 5 and Salvianus Gne. 1 l ξ 4.)

’ §td Democritus simulacra, Epicurus imagines: Ihave said (on 1
49) that it seemed to me probable that some of the later Epicureans had
adopted the more spiritual theism of Democritus. In this passage how-
ever I understand Cio. to bo drawing a distinction between the crude
intermundian gods of Epicurus and the Democritean spirits of the air.
We may compare the distinction in Sext Emp. 1x42‚ where the doctrine
of the εἴδωλα is ascribed to Democritus the φαντασία εἷδιόλυν, the ssightly
vision of ime-ges to Epicurus, τό δὲ ε’ίδυλα εἶναι ἐν τῷ περιέχοντι ὑπερφυῆ
