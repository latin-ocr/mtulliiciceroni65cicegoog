aspicitur ‘the Scorpion is seen as he rises’. But it may be a question
whether the quotation was not at first shorter, and whether the words
atsere ostendens emergit may not have been added, as in a former quotation,
“ from the Pharnaceam see crit. n. The omission ofntin nse is probably¹
accidental owing to the -nr preceding, unless capientur is a corruption for
οοριοίιο nt, the Imperative being, more naturally than the Ind.‚ followed
by nt with Ind

ostendens emergit: some edd. have emergent ostendit, but it is not
uncommon for themora important word 10 be thus subordinated to the
less important, as in 1 115 nanno omnin confinem sancitae, where we
might have expected fena conficit.

alte: Baehrens and Orelli read nito with Grotius, ‘rising out of the
deep '. Alte is common in the older poete, as of the sun in Lucr. 1v 404
jader eripere alte, v 610 roceo alte lampade t .

posteriore trahens—Arcum: ‘drawing aner it abent bow with its

powerful tail'. Oic. here mistakes the force of l. 305 ἅνέλκετοι ἐγγύθι κέν- ’

l. 311, 668. The Archer, whom Cic. calls Sagittipotens (Placen, 73) Sopat-
terina (L 279) Arcitenens (l 405), was' supposed to be a centaur. I read
flexum here with Sch, as it is found in all the Mes of the Phaenon. and
there seems no reason why Ο. should have changed it for the hyperbolical
plenam, which means ‘tied in a knot ².

(luem propter-Ales: five lines are here omitted containing the ante-
cedent to qnam. As it stands, it can only be armen, which gives a wrong
position for the Ales (on which see § 112). The corresponding line 85
in the Placen. begins with qnam referring to the antecedent Sagitta in l. 84,

either that with which Apollo slew the Cyclopes or that with which
Hercules killed the eagle 01 Prometheus. convolvitur: referring 10
the rotatory movement 01 the heaven.

Aquila se portat: cf. Pteen. 24 ot'ctor pedes portat. The eagle is
called Jove Ater nentina (Placen. 294); 11 is alluded to by Eur. literar 530.
For cnm corpore cf. above § 106 carn pergite.

deinde Delphinus: Aratus continues (l. 316) Δελφὶς δ’ οὔ μάλα πολλὸς
ἐπιτρέχει Αῖγοκερὶγῖ. According to Geminus it was raised to heaven by
Neptune for revealing the hiding-place of Amphitrite ; others identified it
with the dolphin 01 Arion.

of Taurus’) ὑποκέκλιτοι αὐτὸς Ὠρίων. In Homer he appears as amighty
hunter, σθένοι Ὠρίωνος, eyed by the bear he is pursuing (12.an 486), and
following the chase even in the lower world (oa. 111572) Ὠρίωνα πελώριον
