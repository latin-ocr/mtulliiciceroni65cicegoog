vacatione: exemption from military service was granted to those who
held a priesthood or a magistracy, oron the ground of eminent merit,
cg. to Aebutius for giving information about the Bacchanalia (Liv. xxx1x
19 4), to the scldiers who had joined Octavius and Hirtius against
Antonius (Paapp. v 53). Exemption for five years was granted to the
Praenestinas in the and Punic war for their brave defenoe of Casilinum.
In times of emergency the Senate might pass a decree ‘ne vacationa
calana (Philipp. v 12, Marquardt 111 2 p. 289).

Locri: these were the L. Epizephyrii, a colony sent out by the
Locrians of Opus probably in the 'lth cent ac. who first occupied the
’ Bruttian promontory of Zephyrium, and afterwards moved to a site 15 m.
further to the north They paid divine honours to their national hero
Ajax son of Oileus, regularly leaving a place for him in their linc of battle
(Paua 111 19 § 11 with n. by Siebelis), and sending yearly to Ilium two
maidens chosen by lot to serve as ministare in the temple of Athene, by

⁸ way of atonement for the rape of Cassandra (Preller Gr. M. 11454, Plut.

S. N. Vincl. c. 12 with Wyttenbach’s n). The river Sagra separated

fies it with the Turbolo, a precipitous torrent running between rocky
banks; near the mouth of this there is a narrow pass, like that of
Thermopylae, which, hc thinks, afl'ords a natural explanation of the victory
of the Locrians. Ηο gives aa. 560 as the date for the battle. In N. D.
111130ic.alludes to the proverb ἀληθέστερα τῶν ἐπὶ Σάγρᾳ, which Suidas
s. v. ἀληθής explains as follows: the Locrians being threatened by Crotona
asked help of Sparta, from which many of their citizens had come, but the
Spartans dcclined to give them any thing but the Dioscuri, ie. probably
the images or symbols (δόκανα) which were carried with the kings on their
warhke expeditiona (So the Greeks asked for the Aeacida before the
battle of Salamis.) The Locrians accepted this as a good omen, went to
the shrine, and offered sacrifices to the Twin Goda When the news of
the victory came the Spartans refused to believe it; hence the proverb·
is used ἐπὶτῶν ἀληθῶν μέν, οὗ πεπιστευμένων δέ. In the battle it is said
that 120,000 Crotoniates were ranged against 15‚000 on the side of Locri ;

afterwards. Among other marvels related in connexion with this war we
are told that the two Crotoniate generals Leonymus and Phormion, having
