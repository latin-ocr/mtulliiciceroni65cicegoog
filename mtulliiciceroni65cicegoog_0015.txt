Ob, Providential government inferred from a consideration of
the Divino nature: (1) It is a part of our idea of God that he should
be active, and active in the noblest wey, and consequently in regard
to tho noblest object, i. e. the universe: (2) if he is not so, then he
must'be inferior to some other power which rules the universe3 but
such inferiority contradicts the very definition of Deity 5 therefore
he cannot be subject to any other power ; therefore he must rule the
universe himself: (3) the Gods form a communsty, and itis natural
to suppose that they possess those same social virtues, which we
believe that we bave derived from them; but that they possess theru
in higher perfectiori and manifest them on a voster scale in the great

displayed in the universe and the heavenly bodies and agree that

these are divine, we confess that all things are ordered by divine
Providence. · (ξ tlt-80.

esplained as the result of intelligence. Nature exhibite a skill
infinitely beyond the reaeh of art, but even art testifies to the exist-
ence and intelligence of the artist. If the orrcry attests the wisdom
of Archimedes, much more must the movements of the hoavcnly
bodies attest the wisdom of the Creator. (4) The absurdity of
attempting to explain the universe as the result of the fortuitous
concoursc of atoma (5) Custom blinds men, or thoy could not fail

to acknowledge that the wonders of nature are the works of God.

and other elementa ξ( 98-101. (2) The sun, lnoon, and planete.
§§102‚ 103. (3) The constellatione. ξ( 104-115. (4) The several
parts of the universe are held together bya strong ceutripetal force,
which is the cause of warmth and light to all things and out of
which all are developed anew in the cyclical regeneration. ξ( 115-
