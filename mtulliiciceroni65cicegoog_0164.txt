and ἔφεσις which impels the 11111, and Eudemus says that the movement
01 the heaven must be a vital movement (ζωτική πως) like ours on carth,
for it is seli-impelled (Brundis Soloi. p. 433 1 45). Α1111. seems 10

appetite (ὄρεξις) moves the will, 11 times the will the appetite, like the
sphere ', which Trendelenburg explains of the highest sphere which carries
round with 11 111 the inferior planetary spheres; the readings however
vary. On the other hand there is a curicus passage (Mat. 11110 p.
1075 a) in which necessity seems 10 be attributed 10 the movements of the
heavenly bodies in contrast to the spontaneous movements of the inferior
members 01 the universe, see Grant's comment upon it in his essay on
Aristotlc’s 0000101100 of Natura. Bernays Dici. Arist. p. 103 foll. thinks
· that'Aristotle may have spoken 01 1111 11111 having a motion 01 their own
(ἐφ’ ἑαυτῶν) distinct from the motion which we regard as natural, and
that O.’s 0010111011 may have arisen from 1 confusion between this and ἐφ’
ἑαυτοῖς, ‘a motion depending on themselves'; but the passages cited by
Bywater in the ,1001001 of Phiioioyy make it probable that Arist. in his
popular dialogue may have attributed voluntary action to the 11111, and
certainly in the preceding paragraphs of the N. D. the orderly movements
of the stars 111 ascribed to their own intelligence, not to any superior
power. ἵ
