ὀστῶν, and again a little below πάντα τὰ ὀστᾶ συνδέδεται νεύροις. Itis
plain that Aristotle here means sinews by νεῦρα, but in θον. Aa. v 2 we
read oi πόροι τῶν αἰσθητηρίων ἁπάντων (i. e. the proper nervas) τείνουσι πρὸς
τὴν καρδίαν, Jcoeut. c. 3 cited by Trend. Apim. p. 397 n. Galen is therefore
not ‘guilty of error' (as Lewes says‘Arc'at. p. 168) ‘in attributing toAristotle
the absurdity of deriving all the nervos from the heart'. Sprengel1 534
speaks of Herophilus (fl. about 300 ne.) astho first who derived the nervos
from the brain and spinal marrow, and distinguished between nervas of
motion and sensation, see above § 128 n. Galen (Ηιρρ. et Plat. p. 187 Κ.)
attributes to Hippocrates right views as to the origin of the nervas and
severely condemns Arist. and Praxagoras for deserting his opinions. It
seems this question was connected with that of the seat of the ἡγεμονικόν,
thus in p. 649 Galen states as axiomatic principles (1) ὅπου τῶν νεύρων ἡ
ἀρχή, ἐνταῦθα καὶτὸ τῆς ψυχῆς ἡγεμονικόν, and (2) ἡ ἀρχὴ τῶν νεύρων ἐν τῷ
ἐγκεφάλῳ. The Stoics maintained that the heart was the seat of the
ἡγεμονικόν (Zeller 1v Ρ. 197 foll). ’
