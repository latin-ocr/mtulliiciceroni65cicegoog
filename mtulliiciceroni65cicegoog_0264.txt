also supposed to come from the stars which were conspicuous during the
rainy seasons, see nn. on 110 Aratean section. Geminus (Ureret. p. 56)

but I should put iton somewhat different ground. Nata 001 qaod cora
ramat is the regular constr. 000 Gr. 1 1686: admodum paulam estquod
0001001001 10 also perfectly admissible (000 Madv. 1 365 dam. 1). The edd.
write 0001001011 because 10100001, not 011, has preceded, and therefore the
agent causing the loss, not merely the fact of the loss, has to be added.
The meaning will then be ‘so that nothing hardly perishes‚ or only very
little, which is consumed &c' The subj. on the other hand means ‘only
the very little consumable by iire' R.] “
