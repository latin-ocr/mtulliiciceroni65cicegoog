s· eorum motus 111 orbem circumferretur: Ι have followed sch in
omitting the que efter circam. Heind reads circumquaque, but that seems
to be postolassical. The expression 11161111 ferretur is pleonastic‚ like
61116116 moretm R. P. 111 18, see on caeli impetam below ξ 97.

vi quodam maiore: the same argument is used below ἓ 76 to prove
that God governs the world Aristotle argues (0661. 12) that the circulor
movement cannot be against nature, because, if it were so, it must speedily
die away (asa stone thrown upward).

morus astrorum voluntarius: whether rightly orwrongly ascribed to
Aristotla this was certainly the Staio doctrine, of. §31 aaa sperate and below,
ὃ 54.. Cleomedon 13 makes the general movement of the heaven necessary,
and the particular planetary movaments voluntary, κινεῖται μὲν καὶ τὴν σὺν
τῷ κόσμῳ κίνησιν ἀναγκαίως, κινεῖται δὲ καὶ ἑτέραν προαιρετικήν. In fact the
word προαιρετική becomes with him technical in this application, as in 11 1
pp. 81 and 84. Lucretius alludes to the Stoio doctrines v 78 praeterea 66116

impie faciat: cf. Philo 1116611. 11111111. p. 489 Μ. ‘Aristotle charged
with impiety (δεινὴν ἀθεότητα κατεγίνωσκε) those who thought that the Visiblo
divinity, who ambrones in himself the sun and moon and all the heavenly
host, was to be compared with tha works of men's hands’. Lactantius 11 5
accepts the challenge here given, 61 deos 6666 idcirco opinamur qaia 661166
61 rationabiles 6616111 tabent, errant. Ea 1166 enim apparet deornm 6166,

noo multum interest : is this an unseasonable piece of anti-Epicurean
polemio inserted by Cicero, or ia it a cantion added by the original writer
against a special point in the Aristotelian theologyl
