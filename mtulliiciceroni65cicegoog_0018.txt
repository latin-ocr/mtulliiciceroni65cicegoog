SOURGES OF THE SECOND BOOK. xvii

Bonn 1878, and, 101 the latter, Schiche De font. lib. de Divinatione,
Ι,10110 1875, Hartl'elder Die Quadra 0. Ciceros ‘de Divinatione:
Freiburg 1878. But the strongest argument 101 the Posidonian
authorship 01 the original which Oicero here follows, is to be found
in an examinatior 01 the book itself, in 1110 agreement between the
opinions there expressed‚ and opinions elsewhere attributed to Posi-
doniuspsometimes in opposition 10, 01 111 contradistinction 110111,

'Phe main points 01 distinction between Posidonius and the 810100

general literary testes, (2) his wide scientific interest, (3) 1110 01111110·
11011 101 Plato and Aristotle, and his modification 01 the older Stoic
doctrines so 00 tobring them more into accordance with the Academia
and Peripatetic doctrines. 'As 10 (1) we are told by Strabo 111 2,

01 relieving 1110 philosophical discussions with illustratione from the
poeta and historiens, which again is quite in accordance with 1110
speech 01 Balbus3 compare, for historical illustration, 11 6-.-11 Ι011

from Ennius on 1110 divinity 01 the heavens; from Euripides on 1110

from the impression produced by the sight 01 the first ship 189 ;
110111 Aratus describing the constellations 11 104-1143 from
Aratus again 011 the Golden Age 1 159. We need not suppose
that all these exactly correspond to quotations in 1110 original.
Cicero 1100 no doubt given 01 1111100 examples from Roman *history
instead 01 Greek history ; and Posidonius had not Oicero's temptation
to tax the attention 01 his readers with long quotations from Aratus
It may be said however that, whatever his authority, Oicero's
natural 10010 would have led him 10 rhetorical treatment 01 his
subject: and 11110 10 0011011111 true. On 1110 other hand, it must be
remembered 11101 community 01 10010 would naturally lead him to
select Posidonius in preference 10 other 810100. Ι do not however

lay so much stress on this point as on those which Ι have next
10 deal with.
