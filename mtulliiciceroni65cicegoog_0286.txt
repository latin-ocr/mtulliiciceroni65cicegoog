οἱ νεφροί τὸ οὖρον ἐπισπῶνται ib. pr. et Plat. p. 536 Κ. Again speaking
of the chyle, he says that, after its arrival in the livor, it throws off two
secretione, yellow and blaok bile, and ascende, having now attained its
ruddy hue, ιο the upper part of the liver, U a. Part. 1v <a

ad easdemque portas jecoris confluunt: this, taken by itself, would
agree with Huxley's account of the ‘portal system' p. 56, ‘the bloodis
distributed throughout the liver 'from the cccc ρονιοο, and thence it is
conveyed by small veins which unite into a large trunk (the hepatis vein)
opening into the inferior cerro cccc near the portal fissura ’.

(Galen Hc'pp. ctPlat. p. 200 K). ·

vene cara: φλὲψ κοιλή, οαΠοάἡ μεγάλη by Arist, the great trunk vein,
divided into superior and defertor as it runs into the heart from above or
from below. Hippocrates ap. Gal. Hipp. et Plct. p. 532 K. compares it ιο
the tmnk of a tree which has its root in the liver and intestinae

uncommon with O. ιο omit the proposition in the second ol a pair of com-
pounds into which the same proposition enters, ct Madv. ria. 111 36.

acorde distribuitur: The beart was the origin of the veins and blood
according to Plato Tim. 70 ἅμμα τῶν φλεβῶν καὶ πηγὴν τοῦ περιφερομένου
κατὰ πάντα τὰ μέλη σφοδρῶς αἵματος, and Arist. Part. Aa. 119 ἀρχὴ τῶν
φλεβῶν ἦ καρδία, ib. 11 1 ξ 22 ἔχει ἐν αὑτῇ τὴν δύναμιν τὴν δημιουργοῦσον τὸ
αἷμα πρώτην. The followers of Hippocrates on the contrary asserted that
the blood originated in the livor and was only distributed from the heae ,
Galen argues in favour of this view Ηίρρ. ct Plot. p. 531.

ventriculum cordis: κοιλίαι τῆς καρδίας oi Arist. The functione of the
ventricles are thus described by Huxley p. 55 z the contractiones the right
auriolo drives the blood which it contains into the right ventriele; the
ventricle then contracte and forces it into the pulmonary artery ; from hence
it pasees into the capillaries of the lungs. After being thus aerabd it
