246 Boou 11 cn. xiix § 1242

platalea: Plin. N. Η. x 40 copies this, slightly aiter-ing the name,
platea acominatus adroldus acl eas quae se ia οιανί mergunt, etcopita illarum
morsu corrupisse cloaeo capturam extorqueat, eadem cum decoratis se
impleuit coactis calore reatris coctas evomit, atque lta ea iis cecideras legit,
testas eaceraeas. No earlier or independent authority is cited for this
characteristic, but it agrees with the accounts given of the Frigate or Man·
of·War Bird (Palicanus aquile Linn.) and also of the Slus stercorario
(bapt. Chol), ‘they pursue the Seamews and Terns, which may be
termed their purvcyors, and sometimes even Boobies and Cormorants‚ their
only aim being to deprive these birds of the prey they have caught. They
pursue, harass and beat them, until they have forced them to disgorge and
drop their booty, which they catch before it falls into the sea '. See also
Eapl. Cyol. under Palicanus and Booby. The word platea is the regular
name for the Spoonbill, which has no such propensity: Philo cle Aalautl.
ξ 31 calls the bird poelotes. '

quae se in mari mergerent : ‘divers ’, which the pelicen is not.

cum emersissent piscemque cepissent: ‘had come to the smiace
with a fish '‚ a sort of hysteron-proteron.

captum amitterent: Allan cites cure. 1v 6 praeteruolans coruus
plebum, quam unguibus ferebat, subito amau, cf. also 2 Verr. 1v 44 praeda
’ζ’ ole mortibus αοιίςοα.

, 111 quod ipsa invaderet: ‘for the other ‚to pounce upon for itself'.

. ''q'' ⁶

This is the usual construction in (lia, cf. 2 Phil. 77 ιἰι collum incasit, and
Soh. Opust. 111 337.

- 1101101118 complere: taken from Arist. H. A. ix 10 οί πελεκᾶνες οί ἐν τοῖς
ποτομόῖς γινόμενοι καταπίνουσι τὰς μεγάλας κόγχας καί λείας· όταν δὲ ἒν τῷ πρό

ωσιν. Aelian H. Α. v 35, and Plut. Sol. Aa. p. 9610010110 something
about the heron (ἐρωδιός ardeo). By πρὸ τῆς κοιλίας Arist. probably means

- the pouch (προηγορεοίν Ael. l. c), as he uses much the same langnage of the
‘crop’ cf fowls, H. A. 111701 μὲνγὰρ ἔχουσι πρὸ τῆς κοιλίας σρολόβαν οἷον
ἅλεκτρνοίν...οί δὲ προλόβον μὲν οὐκ ἔχουσιν, ἀλλ’ ἀντὶ τούτου τὸν στόμαχον (the
gullet) εὐρὺν καί πλατὺν ἢ δι’ ὅλου (as the λάρος καὶ καταῤῥόκτης),.,.ἕνιοι δὲ
τῆς κοιλίας adripere ἔχουσιν όμοιον προλόβῳ (translated by Pliny XI 79). (li
Part. Au. 111 14 ‘owing to the absence of teeth birds have τὸν καλούμενον

the onocrotalus, which is evidently the pelican‚ (x 66) olorum similitudinem

on which see below § 135, any more than Pliny did by his neuter (c. 40
cited above), still less Aelien (111 10) 1)] his ἐν μυχῷ τῆς γαστρός.
