longe comus osb fusum=ffbxerna because the Hydra πάνυ ἐπὶ μήκιστον
ἐκτέταται, as Theon says in his Sedet, extending over three Signs. It was
identified by the Greeks with the Lernaean Hydra. The Egyptians said
it denoted the Nile, which overflowed its banks during the three 001-
responding months, the (lup being the national symbol, and the Raven the
slime left behind after the inundation The more common story told by
Ovid (F. 11 2431011) isthat a raven 0001 1)] Apollo waited 01 the fountain
for some fige 10 ripen, and then seizing a snake in its 010110, laid upon it
the blame of its own delay, 1110 0111100100 morae, 01001101 obsessor 00001001,
tte 1011011 fontes affictamque 11100111. The all-sesing Deity punished the raven
by condemning it to perpetual thirst during the time of the ripening 01
figs; and the moral lesson was enforced by being written in the sky, see
Hyg. 11 40.

serrat εἴδωλον Κόρακος σπείρην κόπτοντι ἐοικός. καὶ μὴν καὶ Προκύων Διδύμοις

tremam: 00. hydram. The form cratem occurs elsewhere in 01000 well
as in Livy and Ηο1000; Nonius reads creterra in this passage.

Vitruvius knows it). The edd have 0010000001 (as Baehrens) 01 0010000001

in two words (with most of the 1100), which may be compared to the 101100 -

pro 0001010, pro praetore ; but, as these gave rise to the forms pro-roraret,
pro-praetor, so Araccaeis would be formed to represent the Gr. προκύων,
, and this is the form we find regularly used in the Selrelia 10 Germanicus
(000 crit. nn.) Similarly we have aatepes Oic. Placere. 452, 00101100100110101·

and put the second half in the Aoo.

Cicero mentions in all 48 01010 or constellatione, omitting the following
from the list 01 Aratus, 1101100101οζ0 (πρατρυγητήρ) after Virgo ; Deltoton
(Ptaert. l 4) after Artem Sagittarius (Pdaert 72), unless we identify this
with Areas, after 80010100,ο 0011001Ρο1110 (Phara. 140) 01101 Aryo;

’ Piscis Australis and Aqua after 110010 (Phara. 167). Of these Pistris alone

is of importance: 00 the omission misplaoes the constellation which follows:
perhaps we ought to supply tarn Pt'rtrrlc with Lescal and Bouh before 11000
Aries. It is worthy of note that the scribes have not attempted to supply ’
these omissione from the 1310100011οω which suggests a doubt as 10 the
supposed interpolation in § 112.
