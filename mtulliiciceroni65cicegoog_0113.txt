towards the south and there the augur sat waiting for the auspices. Some
of the edd. omit 100106 Scipionis as a gloss, but 11 16 001 such 6 gloss 66
06 should have expected from an ordinary scribe, and its correctness has
been recently confirmed by the discovery of the ns of Granius Licinianus,
edited 1858 by a ι100016εό1 Bonn philologers. (The writer is variously
assigned to the age of Augustus 00 10 that 01 the Antoninos or even later.)

in the gardens of D. Brutus 106 the purpose of'practising their art, where ’
Reid says ι661106 augins required for their practice an open space whence

should prefer Lamb.'s in 100116, which seems 1ο have been the common
phrase, 10 Sch's 0011000106, which would merely state vaguely that the
auspices were taken near the gardens. We cannot, Ι think, take the
phrase to be orat. obt. of tabernaculam captam est 10011 Scipionis, like ini-

added in apposition, ‘he remembered that his augural tent-the gardens
