It 10 evident that the subject of Natural Theology 10 one which
requires forits treatment a wide acquaintance with scienee3 and in
point 011001 we find this book of (licero’s dealing more or less
with almost all the sciences known tc the 1110101110, from the most
general physica] speculatione down to particular theories 01 geo-
metry and astronomy and the various sciences 01 011001νο1101,
such as geography, botany, aoology‚ anatomy, anthropology, and
sociology. Now we know that Posidonius was generally regarded as ·
the most learned and most scientifio of all the Stoic philosophers3

’ thus Galen, who quotes him largely on questions relating to human·

physiology and psychology, calls him 0‘ ἐπιστημονικῶτατος τῶν Στῳικῶν
διὰ τὸ γεγυμνάσθαι κατὰ γεωμετρίαν (Hipp. 01Ρ101.ρ. 652 Κ.) ; Cleo-
medes confesses that he compiled his treatise on Astronomy principally
from his writings (0100111. 11 7 rd πολλοὶ τῶν εἰρημένων ἐκ τῶν τοῦ Ποσει-
δωνίου εἰλήπται), and Strabo, who often cites him in his Geography,
speaks 01111111 as α’νὴρ τῶν καθ’ ἡμᾶς φιλοσόφων πολυμαθέστατος (Str.
xvi 2 1 10). Ι shall proceed 10 show in detail that, 00101 as we are
able to test the matter, there 10 0 remarkable agreement between the
scientific views 01 Posidonius and those put forward in this book.
First as 10 Astronomy‚ which occupies the most prominent place in
the argument, Cicero refers expressly to the orrery 01 Posidonius
(1 88), as illustrating and justifying the process by which we infer
the existence 01 asuperintending mind from 1110 observation 01 the
movements 01 the heavenly bodies. What Cicero says 01 the con-
stitution of the sun and planels, and 01 their being nourished by
terrestria] vapours‚ is in accordance with what we are told 01 the
views 01 Posidonius (see 11 39, 40, 118 with the notes). When
010010 10110110 that the sunis many times larger than the earth
(1 92), that the moon 10 rather more than half the size 01 the earth
(1 103), that Venus and Mercury are between the earth and the
sun (152), 011 this agrees with what we read in Oleomedes, some
times with the express addition that he is quoting from Posidonius,
while it is inconsistent with the views of the older Stoice. The same
agreement is to be found in regard to the properties 01 the sphere
and its peculiar mobility (1 40), the stability 01 the universe and the
question as 10 the chlic (lonflagration, on which Posidonius appears
to have expressed himself as doubtfully as 010010(1185, 115, 118).
Lunar influence again (11 10, 50, 110) was 0 1010111110 study 01
Posidonius He was the first to establish the true theory 01 the
tides (000 nn. on 11 10, 132), the inquiry into which was stigmatized
