tnined and fed: 61 6161116616 the grosser feeds the purer; earth the sea, earth

moon ; whence, in her visage round, those spots, unpurged vapours, not yet ·
into her substance turned. Nor doth the moon no nourishment exhale
from her moist continent to higher orbs. The sun, that light imparts to
ull, receives from all his alimental recompense in humid exhalatione, and

held by Xenophanes (Zeller 1 p. 500, Karsten p. 161), Anaximander (Zeller
p. 206 1611), Heraclitus (Zeller p. 622 61161162 Bywater, νέος ἐφ’ ἡμέρῃ
1111111νὶ1161), Philolaus, who speaks of the lunar vapour as part of the
nourishment of the world (Zeller p. 410, Boeckh p. 111), Democritus, who
identified these exhalatione with the ambrosia 61 the poete (Zeller 1 p. 802).

long before pointed out the absurdity of supposing that the sun was really
fed by evaporation‚ Meteorol. 11 2 ξ 5 ‘the exhalatione which rise from the
sea are condensed by the cold of the upper air and return again iu rain,

ὑγρῷε they argued that 116 required nutriment3 but if this were the case,
the sun would be merely the combustion of ever-changing fuel Itis really
like the boiling 61 water; the 116 beneath the kettle is not fed by the
steam, of which it is the cause’; ibid. 12 ‘all that is taken up comes
' down iu rain sooner or later'; Pluc. Phil. 11 17 (Aristotle says) μι) δεῖσθαι

amusaeterum to his note (Praef. p. 11) 6111666111 723 this would
mean ‘could have continued', but there is no reason why we may not take
it ‘could continue under the supposed circumstances, 111. without food', cf.
Roby§ 1034.
