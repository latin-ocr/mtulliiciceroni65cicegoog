which the people were considered to form an army), had to 116 taken
outside the pomerium. The irregularity committed by Gracchus is ex-
plained as follows by Bouche-Leclercq 1v 230, ‘we must imagine the
magistrate who leaves the city, as carrying with him in a manner the
auspices and the temple. Il fallait qu'avant de partir, il allit chercher cet
attirail abstrait sur le Gapitole, 011 ilconsultait tout d'abord Jupiter: il
marchait alors, vers la porte, s’arretait un instant sur 16 pometiam pour
interroger mentalement le ciel et poursuivait sa route, environne de son
temple ideal’ ; p. 235 ‘a magistrate returning to the city lost the military
auspices and had to go through all the ceremonias again to acquire them.
Gracchus forgot this on his way back from the city to the Campus Martius
and passed the pomerium without going through the necessary formalities'.
On the other hand, Mommsen (016000011093, 100), considers that
the negligence was shown in passing the stream Petronia ; this however is
notin accordance with G’s words 6006 panariam transiret ‘in crossing'.
Plutarch gives a different 'account from either (Marcell. 5): when a
'magistrate seated in 1116 tabescentem 10 01166116 the auspices is compelled
