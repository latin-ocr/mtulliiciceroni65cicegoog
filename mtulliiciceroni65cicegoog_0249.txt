Ernesti argues that it must mean ‘bent beck ', and thet the word does not
necessarily imply more then ‘stiffiy bent' in whatever directior. Appe-
rently it has the seme force in Lucilius' line resupinae obstipo 0111110 siti
1011111 faeere caniculae, if I rightly understand it of ladies leaning beck and
fanning themselves Lueretius uses it (1v 517) of a building out 01 the

mann on Hor. l. c. says it is technically used for a 01111 neck in medical
writers. Ι should translate therefore ‘the head is slented, thrown beck from
the shapely neck; you would say it fixed its gaze on the teil of· the Great
Beer '. I see 110100001110101111311111110100111100111101100011101 into aa

hoc ceput: 0. is fond of this rather elumsy demonstrative, which is
here however justified by the Greek (1. 61) κείνη που κεφαλὴ τῇ νήχεται, ᾗχι
περ ἄκραι μίσγονται δύσιές τε καὶ ἀντολαὶ ἀλλήλῃσιν. Hipparchus explains
this to mean thet the head, the most southern part of the constellation,
being precisely 37ο from the pole, just touches the horizon in the latitude
of Athens. It thus skims the surface of the ocean (the poetic word for
horizon) at the point where its settings and risings meet If it were
further from the pole, the risings end settings would be separated by an
intervel; 11 neerer, there would be no setting ; but it is ἐπὶ τοῦ ἀεὶ φανεροῦ
κύκλου, which among the Greeks was called the Aratio circle, 01 course
varying with the latitude ι the Antarctic circle was ὁ ἀεὶ ripaeis κύκλος.
Hipp. would not have approved 01 030 translation 01 Aratus, for, in opposi-
tion to a commentator named Attalus, he expressly says οὐ biver βραχὺν
χρόνον καὶ diarchia: 00 the pseudo-Eratosthenes speaks of the Δράκοντος
κεφαλή es being on the horinon.
