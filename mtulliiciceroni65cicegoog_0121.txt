but as below§ 104, the dotting about of siars, the varied grcupingof con- ’
stellations.

utilitatem: edd. adopt the conjecture of Manutius, uarietatem, which
is more in agreement with the context, but I think the 'text may be
defended. Beauty and utility are often joined as the two characteristica of
the universe, see halcu, ξ 87, 155, Orci. 111178 ut iu uocisque rebus
incredibiliter hoc παίοιτο eat ipsu fubu'cata, aie iu oratioue, ut eu, quue
maximum utilitatem iure coutiuereut, plurimum eudem habereut uel uliqui-
tutis uel saepe etium uetustam: itis then shown that it is so with the
heavenly bodies. Oleom. 1 1 gives, as one proof of a governing Reason, that

ἀποτελεῖν. Nor is it necessarpr to suppose that O. would have been pre-
cluded from speaking of the utilitur of the sun and stars here, because he
has spoken of the commoda received from the temperatio caeli in ξ 13.
He is far from punctilious about his divisione, and he might treat of the
benefit of light apert from that of heat to which he confines himself in the
earlier ξ.

ut: followed by multo uagis instead of sir. The comparison of the
world to a house is here used to prove that it must be governed and
