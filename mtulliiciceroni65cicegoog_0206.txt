from it exn of frigidity (τὸ ψυχρόν), not unlike that in the text, e. g. ‘it
was natural thatthe instrument of divine vengeance 011 the mutilators of
the Hermae should be Hermocrates’. Cic. praises his learning and copious-
ness (Orat. 1158), but is not an admirer cf the Asiatic style which he
practised, cf. Brut. 325 peoora 1111011000 dictioais 0100 sura, anam sarecto-
ουοι et erpeium, scatentia 000 tam praeibas et severis qaam 000010οὼ ef
00001110, qualib io 11110110 Piraeeus. Of Hegesias, a professor of the same
Asiatic school, to whom the saying in the text is attributed by Plutarch
(Alea. 3) Cic. speaks even more severely (Brut. 206) qaid cet tom fractam,
tam mirratum, tam 10 epea, quam tamea coo-sequatur, immensae puerile?
-These passages prove that 00001000 need not be taken to imply veryr high
praise, any more than our ‘neat saying' or ‘pretty conceit'. Plutarch, in
telling the story, himself outdocs the frigidity of Hegesias, Ἡγ. ἐπιπεφώνη-
κεν ἐπιφώνημα κατασβέσαι τὴν πυρκαΐαν ε’κιίνην ὑπὸ ψυχρίας δυνάμενον·
εἰκότως γάρ ἔφη καταφλεχθῆναι τὸν νεῶν τῆς Ἀρτέμιδος άσχολουμένης περὶ
τὴν Ἀλεξάνδρου μαίωσιν.

partu Olympiadis: the Dat, Olympiadi might have seemed more
natural with adesse, but partas is often used witha Genitive cf the mother

Venus: Arnobius (111 33) follows Ο. in his absurd derivation: itis
probably connected with acaia ‘grace', ⁴ favour', vcaaor, Sans. rualli ‘wish’.
Varro L. L. v 62 derives it from oirwio vieo.

formae deorum ε the Stoics are laughed at (1 24) for believing in round
gods, but really they essign no form to their highest divinity, the all per·
vading ether. Thus we are expressly told that Posidonius held God to be

καὶ συνεξομοιούμενον πᾶσιν (Siob. Eoi. Ι 2); so thab Lactantius is right (dc
