quodsi mundi partes natura administrantur: we have had the
same thing said at the beginning of § 83 and of ξ 86,

quod effici optimum potuit: we find this admissiones a necessity
limiting the action of Providence, both in Chrysippus (πολὺ τὸ τῆς ἀνάγκης
μεμῖχθαι, on which Plutarch remarks that, if so, οὔτε κροτεῖ πάντων ὁ θεός,
οὔτε πάντα κατὰ τὸν ἐκείνου λόγον διοικεῖται St. Καρ. 37) and in Seneca, Proo.

demtis, ot died Chrysippeos et Cleanthes, mitit praetermisit pertinentiam ad
certiorem utilioremque dispensationem. omo si aliter melias esset dmpessori
res maadi, eo modo sumpsisset compositorem Galen Ua Part. x1 14 εἶναι γάρ
τινα λέγομεν ἀδύνατα φύσει, καὶ τούτοις μηδ’ ἐπιχειρεῖν ὅλως τὸν θεόν, ἀλλ’ εἰε τῶν

Vol. Herc. v1 53 (Zeller1v 178) ‘the Stoice while they assign all power to
God', ὅταν ὑπὸ τῶν ἐλέγχων πιέζονται, τότε καταφεύγουσιν ἐπὶ τὸ διὰ τοῦτο
φάσκειν τὰ συναπτόμενα (what is fitting) μὴ ποιεῖν, ὅτι οὔπάντα δύναται. 011
the Stcic theodicy generally see Zeller p. 173 foll, and compare the doc·
trine maintained by Leibnitz Theod. 1 ξ 8 ‘il domeure toujours vrai qu’il
y a une infinite de mondes possibles dont il faut que Dieu ait choisi le
meilleur, puisqu’il ne fait rien sans agir suivant la supreme raison'; also
J. S. Mill's Timism Pt 2, where he argues in favour of the hypothesis
of a benevolent Creator ‘working undcr the limitation (quod potuit) cf
inexorable laws and indestructible properties of matter ².

ξ 87. ergo : elliptical, ‘ycudenyitf Then let some one show abetter'.
ef, ξ 77 erpo etrum ipsoram, and the clliptical force of ἐπεί with Im-
perative

potuisse melius: compare the famous saying of Alphcnso of Oastile
(A, D. 1252), ‘If the Creator had consulted me, the world would have been
constructed on a simpler and better plan' (than that of Ptolemy). Theory
is put in place of fact, and the supporters of the theory require it to be
accepted as perfect and divine. St Paul takes a different view cf the
existing order of nature: with him ‘the whole creation is groaning and ¹
travailing together, waiting for the manifestaticn of the sons of God’.
And a philosopher like Butler does not pretend to maintain the perfectiori
of the order cf nature, as it is atpresent known to us: he only asserta
that we dc not know enough to pronounce positively that it is imperfect

posuerit: completed future indicative. Quod potuerit is to desiderabit
what qaod potuit would be to desiderat. Both denote what could not
have taken place before the time of the principal verb. Cicero says ‘any
fancied improvement will be either a deterioraticn or an improvement
precluded by the nature of things ³. Poterit would be out of place here
as it would denote a subsequent time. Quod Jieri mort poterit, facere como-
biter would describe the impotency of a constructor: qaod fieri moa
potuerit, desiderabit reproves the vanity of the critic. ‘He will be re-
grettiug the absence of that, which could not possibly have been therc’. a]
