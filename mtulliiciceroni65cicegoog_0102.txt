of the latter he inherited a part of his kingdom, and foretold the fortunas

P. Claudius Pulcher: consul 249 no, was defeated by Adherbal in the
sea-fight off Drepanum. He was tried for high treason, but there is some

be placed in iront of the battle, so that the vongeance oi the Gods might

killed by a chance jevelin and the Romans won the victory.
