ἕκαστον εἶναι νοερὸν καὶ φρόνιμον πύρινον δὲ πυρὸς τεχνικοῦ· δύο γὰρ γένη
πυρός, τὸ μὲν ἀτεχνον καὶ μεταβάλλον είς ἑαυτὸ τὴντροφήν, τό δὲ τεχνικὸν αύξητι-

Aristotle seems to allow the name ‘fire’ for the latter in a passage from
Rupit. c. 8, quoted on ξ 23 quod eu calidum, and duim. Gau. 111 11 cited
below on uuiuuutium ortus; but elsewhere he argues strongly 011 the
other side, as in Meteon 13 ‘if the intervals between the heavenly bodies
were full of lire, and if they were themselves composed of fire, all the
other elements would have been burnt up. Fire has not the power of
generating life, as the sun has, πῦρ μὲν οὐθὲν γεννᾷ ζῷον...ἡ δὲ τοῦ ἠλίου
θερμότης καὶ ἦ τῶν (permixta ζωτικὴν ἀρχήν. The life-giving principle is
πνεῦμα καὶ ἠ ἒν τῷ πνεύματι φύσις ἀνάλογον ούσα τῷ τῶν ἀστρων στοιχείῳ

. (ef. Zeller 111 p. 483 1011). Ether extends from the uttermost circumference
to the moon, becoming less pure as it approaches the air below the moon.
The upper portion of the air becomes ignited by the rapid motion ol the
celestial spheres and thus generatas the heat we feel'3 ibid 1 4 § 2‘there
are two kinds of evaporation (ἀναθυμίασις), 0110 damp from moisture, the
other dry and smoke-like from earth; the latter rises higher and forms
the belt of fire improperly so called, because what we know by the name
of fire is the combustion of this warm vapour'3 see Stob. Eol. 1 25 p. 534
and Theophrastus fr. 111 6, where he distinguishes between τὸ θερμὸν
(which is a true ἀρχή and the carues of natural growth) and fire, of which
he says τὸ δὲ πῦρ γεννητικὸν μὲν αύτοῦ, φθαρτικὸν δὲ cir ἐπίπαν τῶν ἄλλων,
ὅθεν καὶ δῆλον ὥς ἑτέρα τιςή φύσις πυρὸς καὶ θερμοῦ. The differenda may
be illustrated by the Persian and Egyptian ideas of fire (Herod 11 16)
‘the former believe itte be a god, the latter believe it to be a wild animal,
which eats whatever it can seiae, and then, glutted with the foed, dies with
the matter whioh it feeds upon'. Some of A’s *arguments had been
previously employed by Socrates against Anaxagoras, Xen.Mem.1v7§ 7
ἐκεῖνος γὰρ λε’γων μὲν τὸ αύτὸ εἶναι πῦρ τε καὶ ἥλιον ἠγνόει, (ἀς τό μὲν πῦρ
ol ἄνθρωποι ῥᾳδίως καθορῶσιν, είς δὲ τὸν ἥλιον ού δύνανται ἀποβλέπειν· καί
ύπὸ μὲν τοῦ ἡλίου καταλαμπόμενοι τὰ χρώματα μελάντερα ἔχουσιν, dud δὲ
τοῦ πυρός ού· ἠγνόει δὲ ὅτι καὶτῶν ἐκ τῆς γῆς φυομένων ἄνευ μὲν ἡλίου αύγῆς
οῦδὲν δύναται καλῶς αύξεσθαι, ύπὸ δὲ τοῦ πυρὸς θερμαινόμενα πάντα ἀπόλλυται·
φάσκων δὲ τόν ἠλιον λίθον διάπυρον εἶναι καὶ τοῦτο ἠγνόει, ὅτι λίθος μὶν ἒν
πυρὶ ων oin λάμπει οὕτε πολὺν χρόνον ἀντέχει, ὁ δὲ ἥλιος τὸν πάντα χρόνον
πάντων λαμπρότατος ὧν διαμένει.
