At. The sympathy which unitos all the parts 01 the universe
shows that they 010 pervaded by one Divina Spirit. §§ 19, 20.

Aa. Zeno's argument 101 the divinity of the universe (and
therefore indirectly 101 1110 Divina Existence, since the universe
existe). (1) What has reason is better than what has not reason,
therefore the universe, as the host of things, must possess reason:
similarly it may be proved to ba wiso, blessed, 01011101, and therefore
God. (2) The universe must besentient because ithus sentient
parts. (3) It must be rational because it gives'birth to what is·

rational. §sto-22.

Al. Physical argument for divine existence: (1) 11001 10 the
causa of motion and 01 1110 3 the whole universe is pervaded by heat;
in 11001 we find the governing principle (ἡγεμονικόν) 01 the universe:
therefore it must have in the highest degree 111011000011 which is
found even in the inferior parts 01 the universe. ξ( 23-30. (2)
The mundana heat is far purer than 0111 earthly 11001, 1110101010 11
must possess the properties 01 11001 in 0 101 higher degree; and it
acts freely without any coercion from without. (ᾗ 30, 31. (3)
What is sels-moved 10 soul: the mundane heat is sslf-moved, and
therefore 01 the nature 01 soul. (4) If the universe were not pos·
sessed 01 reason, the whole would be inferior 10 1110 part which is

possessed of reason, which is absurd. § 32.

Aea Argument 110111 the Scale 01 Existence. (1) We ohserve ’

the gradual ascent from vegetable to animal 1110, 110111 animal to
human, the last showing the potentiality of virtue and wisdom:
hence we infer 0 yet higher stage, 1110 divine, which is essentially
and always virtuous and wiso. (133, 34. (2) All things are striv-
ing 01101 perfectiori, but 111 the case 01 1110 lower limited natures,
this tendency cannot fulfil itself: in universal nature it 0011 535.
(3) Since it is confessed that the universe is the hest of all things,
it cannot be limited to vegetahle 01 animal or merely human
existence. It must be actually and essentially wisc and good (and
therefore divine): for 0 potentiality which has never risen into
’ actuality throughout eternity would be inferior to that of man. ξ 36.
(4) Μο11 10 110111 10 contemplate and imitate 1110 1111110100 10 which
he belongs. The universe 010110 10 perfect and its own end. It must
therefore be possessed 01 what is best, via reason. §37. (5) Ideal
excellence can only be found in that which is complete in all its
