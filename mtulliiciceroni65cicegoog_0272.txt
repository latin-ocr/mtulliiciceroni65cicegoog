rius, is usually about three feet long, lives at the bottom of the sea, by
means 01110 fins stirs up the mud in such amanner as 10 conceal 110011
from other fishes, has three long filaments on the upper part 01 the head :
the glittering appendages at the end of these filaments are said 1ο 0111001
the smaller fishes, like a bait. See Ειιῃ. Cyri. Aristotle mentions it in
speaking 01 the stratagems of animala, (H. A. 1137) ὁ μὲνγὰρ βάτραχος τοῖς
πρὸ τῶν ὀφθαλμῶν ἅπακρεμαμίνοις (sc. θηρεύει, ‘ensnares the fish with the
filaments which hang in front of his eyes '), ὦν τὸ μὲν μῆκός ε’στι τριχοειδές,
ἐπ’ ἄκρου δὲ στρογγύλον ὥσπερ προσκείμενον ἐκατέρῳ δελέατος χάριν· ὅταν οὖν
ἐν τοῖς ἀμμώδεσιν ἢ θολερύδεσιν ἀναταράξας κρύψῃ ἔαυτόν, ε’παίρει τὰ τριχύδῃ,
κοπτόντων δὲ τῶν ἰχθυδίων συγκατάγει μέχρι περ ἂν πρὸς τὸ στόμα προσαγάγῃ.
Ηο calls it βάτραχον τὸν ἁλιέα καλούμενον, and so Plin. EN. 111 42 pisca·
tric. Schneider in his note on Arist. 1. 0. says cithia passage 01 Cic. quae·
elam excidisse uideatur, and certainly we should have expected the antece·
dent 10 acl quar to have some reference to the filaments described by
Arist: 11 the reading is correct, Ο. seems 10 have supposed the roua to
have concealed itself in the saud by the sea (prope aquam), not actually
in the sea.

miluo bellum cum corvo: this is described by Arist. H.N.1x 1
ὑφαιρεῖται τοῦ κόρακος ὁ ἰκτῖνος ὅ τι ἂν ἔχῃ, διὰτὸ κρείττων εἶναι τοῖς ὄνυξι καὶ
τῇ πτήσει, but it is 01 other birds, especially the κορώνῃ οηι1γλαύξ, that he

says τὰ ᾠὰ κατεσθίουσιν ἀλλήλων. Plin. 11 25 says the aesalou and chloreus
destroy the eggs of the coruus.

grues trianguli efficere formam: Aristode (Η. Α. 11 10) says a good
deal about cranes‚ but does not give the particulare mentioned by Ο. which
are probably taken from the dialogus De philosophia (see above ἓξ 42,
44, 95). Pliny (N. Η. 1 23 ξ 63) 10110 the same with reference 10 wild

summo angulo : ‘the apex of the triangle'.

way through 11.
