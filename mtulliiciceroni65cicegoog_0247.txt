the following line are quoted in thedoad. 11 66, where 0. compares probable
reasoning to the vaguer guidanoe of Helice, demonstrative reasoning to
Cynosura Fora different application compare Milton’s lines ‘where
perhaps some beauty lies, the Cynosure of neighbouring eyes '. Thales is

Helice: the name is explained either from its revolving round the pole
or from the sorew-like curvatura of the line connecting its stars; see
Ideler a. ol. Urspmap ol. allamma pp. 4-10. For the common myth
see ‘Callisto' in Diot. of Ba'op. According to Aratus they were two nymphs
who nursed the newborn Zeus in Ida and were rewarded by being trans·
lated to heaven

1 t 30 (fr. l. 66 Ribb.) has tetecum lic awderctor mathca If we accept
this explanation, the constellation was compared to seven oxen treading
the corn and going round and round the threshing-floor, an entirely dis·
tinet conception from that of the wain with four stare representing the
wheels and three the pole, called by Ennius temo, by Ovid plaustrum.
Varro's etymology is of course absurd. A more probable explanation is
that given by Max Miiller (lect. 11 364), who connects tab with the Sanscr.
tare, our ‘star', and the Homeric τείρεα (Ιί. xvr11485); see Curtius Gr. Et.
§205. Supposing the existence of two homonymous words, one meaning
‘star’ and the other ‘ox'‚ the identification of the two would be exactly
parallel to the identification ol the two meanings ol the Sansc. aloa,
‘bright' and ‘beare the ‘seven bright stars' were converted into ‘seven
