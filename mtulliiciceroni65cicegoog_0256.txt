intelligible.

Vergilias: Max Mtiller (Leot. 11 p. 7) derives the name ‘from virga a
sprout or twig: the name was given by Italian husbandmen, because in
Italy, when they became visible about May, they marked the return oi
summer '. Others connect it with cer or eergo. The word Πλειάδες 18
usually connected with πλεῖν, as they marked the safe time for sailing, but
Nitzsch (οά. v 272), with whom Vanioek agrees, thinks the form πελειάδες
(Pind. Nec. 11 8) the older, and supposes that they were regarded as a fiock
01 wild doves dying before the hunter Orion, as Hes. op. 619 Πληιάδες
σθένος ὄμβριμον Ὠρίωνος φεύγουσαι. In later times they were believed to
be the daughters 01 Atlas pursued by the love of Orion and saved by being
turned into doves. They are among the five constellations mentioned by
Homer and Hesiod It is said in the Diot. of Act. s. v. that in Arabio
and Old English they were spoken 01 as the Hen and Ohickens.

inde Fides τ Aret. l. 268 καὶ Χελος ἥδ ὀλίγη. (rio. seems to have filled
up his line with otiose epitheta for an ordinary lyra, like his οοοιονιιὲι 00001-
bua of Aries in ξ 111, 11 Mu and Baehrens are right in reading posita et
leviter convexa videtur ‘next to this in position and slightly bowed
outwards appears the Lyre'. Ba has leviter posita: could this mean
‘slightly sketched' (ἀμυδρά in Theon's Solvet.) like Hor. oa. 1v 8 8 sollers
Ιιοιινὶιιοιη ponere? The lact that there is one splendid star in hyra is not
inconsistent with such a description on the part of O. Sch (Opusc. 111
336) suggested positu leviter οοιννονοοι :paulatum 10ιί10010 et obliquata. It
is true Manilius (v1 325) speaks 01 the Lyre as οοιινονοα ‘up side down ’, as
Oic. has puppis οοιινοςοο Piraeo. 127; but what ground hed O. ior such a.
statementl his authority gives no hint 01 a slanting position. Ι111 be
said that this would be apparent in any map or sphere which O. might
have before him, as it is in the Harleian ns; yet there would be no force
in the adverb tacitam the positionis represented as precisely reversed
The Lyre was identified with that first made by Mercury.

explain alitis in the previous line: in the original (l. 275) ἤτοι γὰρ καὶ Ζηνὶ
πορατρέχει αἰάλοςὊρνις, the Schol. take Ζηνί as equivalent to τῷ adparet
(ests aab tegmina a). isuppose alesia to be taken as an epithet here,
though Ba. writes it with a capital. L. and S.· seem to think that Ο.
intended it 10 represent αἰόλος, but it occurs also Plraera 258, without any
Greek equivalent. This constellation was identified by later writers with
