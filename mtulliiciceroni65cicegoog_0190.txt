regi non possea: this is scarcely the description we should have

C. probably applies 10 them what belongs 10 the personified passione which
follow. Even then 0100 deo rapi is hardly a suitable expression. The
supernatura] character 01 these passione is suggested by the fact that
man 10010 himself overmastered by them, that they seem something dis-
tinct from his own persona] being; not because they demand the control
