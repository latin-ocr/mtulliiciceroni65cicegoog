hlc pressu: after three lines Aratus goes on (1 82), ἀμφότεραι (1.0.
χεῖρες) δ’ ’Ὄφιος πετονῆαται ((000 busied with ') dr ῥά τε μέσσον lwetot
Ὀῲιοῦχσνὸ δ’ ἐμμενὲς εὖ &campos ποσσὶν ὕπο θλίβει μέγα θηρίον ἀμφοτέ-

ojus: monosyllabic, as cujas in Lucr. 1 149, see Wagner cn synizesis (in
Plaut Aul. p.nv11).

used 01 a scorpion by (110. 1110. v 42, 01 a crab by Plautus Oua 118 7.
Here and in ξ 114 itis used of the constellation Scorpion, lor which
we find Scorpios in §1133 in Ennius ap. (11011 P.1 3011 might have
either meaning, astrologorum 0190010 00010 000000, 0100001000 cam
capro 001 nepa 001 0000000100οη aliquod 1010ιο0. This ambiguity gave ι
riso 10 the absurd belief mentioned by Plin N.H. rx 51 that, when the
Sun passcs through Cancer, dead arabs lying on the besch are trans-
formed into scorpions. The story 01 the Scorpion and Orion is told by
Cic. Ρ1000. 426 foll Diana to avenge herself on Orion called up the
scorpion from the bowels 01 the earth, 110 calado capelle 00000100 percolat

Septentriones sequitur: O. here omits five lines, in which the con-
stellation Chelae ‘the claws'is referred to. Aratus then goes on (191)
ἐξόπιθεν δ’ Ἑλίκης φέρεται 011600ιέ0κῶ0 Ἀρκτοφύλσξ, τόν ῥ’ ἄνδρες ἐπικλεί-
ουσι Βοώτην, οὕνεχ’ ἁμαξαίης &caponem εἴδεται Ἀρκτου, καί μάλα πᾶς
ἀρίδηλος· ὑπὸ ζώνη δέ ci αὐτὸς ἐξ ι’ίλλων Ἀρκτουρος ἑλίσσεται ἀμφαδὸν
αστηρ.

Arctophylax: see Hyg. 114 and Dico. of Ant. s. v. Astronoma’c. 'l'he
name is merely another form 01 Arcturus, which 10 used for the whole con-
stellation by Hesicd (Op. 566, 610) and others. Bootes occurs in Homer
Od. v 272 Πληιάδας τ’ ἐσορῶντα καὶ ὀψὲ δύοντα Βοαίτην. 11 is used by
Babrius in the sense 01 ‘ ploughman ’, and we find the verb βοωτέω in Hes
Op. 391.

temoni : so Madv. fortemne, ‘es though yoked 10 the pole, ie. wain ’ 3
apparently O. takes ἁμαξαίης as an'adj. agreeing 01111Ἀρκτου. The Beer
would thus consist 01 the three leading stare.

quatit Arctum: the lexa quote quatit equom in the same sense from
deQfflmm

ξ 110. huic Booti: Ι have transposed the words dein quoe 0000οι01ιο,
which precede these in the 000, and placed them aster Vtryo, four lines
below. Heind. was the first to observo that they were not justified by
the omission 01 one or two words 01 the original. This change melros it

necessary either 10 read autem instead 01 enim orto omit the particle alto
gether.
