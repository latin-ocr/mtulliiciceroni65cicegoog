The originator of the theory is probably Heraclitus (fr. 76 Byw. οὗ γη ξηρὴ,
ψυχὴ σοφωτάτη καί ἀρίστη), who was followedby Hippocrates xxvm 31
soll It is interesting, as confirmatory of the Posidonian authorship of the
treatise from which C. is borrowing, te find Strabo attacking Posidonius
for maintaining the influence of climate on character (11 3p. 102 foll).
He seems to have spoken of the distribution of the different parts of the
' earth andthe effect on the character of the people inhabiting thern, as
proofs of divine Providenee, in opposition to which Strabo says, ‘such
arrangements οὐκ ἐκ προνοίας γίνονται, καθάπερ οὐδὲ ui κατίι τὰ ἔθνη διαφοραί
...ἀλλὰ κατὰ ἐπίπτωσιν καὶ συντυχίαν... οὗ γὰρ φύσει Ἀθηναῖοι μὲν φιλόλογοι,

draw the conclusion, as to the existence of beings superior tc man in the ’
higher element, which we find below§ 42 and in Sext Emp. rx 86, εἴη

hastens on at once to another argument, which follows it in Sextus3 see
n. on ettamen below. collocati sint: Zumpt ξ 366 says that, while
we never find O. using a plural verb after a singular noun of multitude,
yet he sometimes employa a plural of the same subject in a following clause,

as here and ρ. Ανοίι. 12, Marcell. 11, Qrtint. 23, Fla. 11170, cf. Madv. .

higher'. The same argument is referred to in the same connexion by Sext. ·
·l. c, (If the air has living beings belonging to it, so, we may infer, must
the ether have beings, of a yet higher grade) ὅθεν καὶ ἄνθρωποι νοερὰς μετέ.

that the following et eam quidem shows that the subject, of which it intro- ·

leaves it indefinite. There is plainly allusion to a mind which indistinct

from that of man and is stated to be keener than it. Hence Seh. and
