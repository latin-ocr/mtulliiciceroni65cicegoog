multae superstites prepter aetutem delirant: aut ucurrdum Lucretium 1 ec
(torribilisuper aspectu muralibus instans) superstitio est superstantium rerum,

L. and S. consider it to denote originally ‘a standing still over or by a
thing; hence amazement, wonder, dread': Grimm D. M. p. 1059 com-
pares it to uberpiaube (iter-plaute) implyinga persistent holding to extra-
vagant belieis which were abandoned by men of sense: Nettleship J. of
Prie. VI p. 98 thinks that it meant originally ‘being present at (compare
superstes in the sense of ‘witness ') and hence knowledge oi a thing orpcn-
dering over a thing '. He quotes passages in which superstitiosus seems to
imply prophetie knowledge, as Plsut Arupi. 1 l. 170 illic toruo superstitiosus

reflexion’3 and cites the Gr. ἐπίσταμαι as illustrating the etymology sug-
gested I must confess I prefer to any of these the 3rd explanation given
by Lact 1v 28. After condemning O.'s as iuepta, he continues superstitiosi
aesteuu 10111111, uua qui fiir'os suos superstites optant (1111111 euim optumus),
sed uut ii qui superstitem memmium deJ‘urretoruni 10111111, urst qui pareatibus
suis superstites 11111111 iutupiues eorum domi tauquam deos Penates. The
same origin ci superstition is 1111011111 in Wisdcm xrv 15 ‘a father afflicted
with untimely monrning, when he hath made an image of his child
soon taken away, now honoureth him ss a god, which was then a dead
man, and delivered to those that were under him ceremonies and sacrifices ¹.
This doctrine of ‘animism ², as it is called by Tylor, Herbert Spencer and
others, evidently had a firm hold oi the early Romans, as shown in their
worship of the Lares and diui Manes, 111 the Noueudiuie, Feralia and Pu·
rentalia, cf. Oic. Lep. 11 55, 57, Lari. 13 (uestri majores) qui mutuis turn
religiosa jura tribuerunt, and the saying of Cato in Plut. vol. 111 p. 411
nidor ‘the proper sacrifices to parents are not lambs or kids, but the tears
of enemies’. With regard to the actual formation of the word Nigidius
Figulus ap. Gell. 1v 9 maintains that the termination lesus always implies
avioious excess, as in the words uiuosus, muiurosus, numerosus. Gellius
adds setosus, 11111111, famosus, pretiosus, but also mentions exceptions,
such as uirtutebus, foruuosus; and a glance at the list in Roby Gr. § 813
is enough to show that there is really no special ethical character attach·
ing to adjectivae oi this formation, Still there is the fact that ono who
. spoke the language had such a feeling about this class of words, and there
can be no doubt as to the particular word superstitiosus, that it was used
of one iniectcd to an excessive degree with superstiti), which itself denotas
