ab iis: the latest edd treat these words asan interpolation. It seems
to me more difficult to explain their insertion, if they did not form part 01
the original text, than to justify their use. 11 0 general word, such as
constiterat referring to the first creation 01 man, had preceded, some such
phrase as this would have been required with the Passive verbs following ;
but even when a word of particular application like eoestrr'ctir appears in
the Aba Abs. its subject may be repeated witha different government
afterwards, see Sch Opere. 111 373, who cites among other exx. (1001110.
11114tcrre'bee metatis temere las altitudo puppium superabat, instead of
terres exortatore. It is more remarkable to find the Abl. of the Agant, not
of the Instrument, used in regard to the. taath, but this sort of personifica-
tion may be paralleled by α lippae in the next sentence, and by§ 139
aereos ο quibas artae contineater, ξ 144 audace α qao eam sones eet eccep-
tes. Sch. would transpose ob iis before atqeee, so as to connect them with
mauditum but the reading constrictis sufficiently explains the action of
manditur, and l think they come in more naturally introducing eatenuatar
&c as a sort of second thought.

extenuatur: 01. Plin. xvm 43 ie pelvem extenuari.

eorum adversi [acuti]: Ithink aceti should either be expelled asa
gloss 01 be altered into coeto. The double epithet would imply that some
front teeth were not sharp.¹ They are called πρόσθιοι by Arist. H. A. 11 1
t 50, and Part. Aa. 111 l ό δ’ ἅνθρωπος ἔχει τοὺς μὲν προσθίους ὀξεῖς ἵνα
διαιρῶσι, τοὺς δὲ γομφίους πλατεῖς ἵνα λεαίνωσιν, primores by Plin. N. Η.
vn16; 01. Oels. vr111qeaterrei primi, qaia secant, τομεῖς α Graecis nomi-
nsoter.

rennui: (yeoe, γένος, ‘chin ’), called also maxillares audaciores. ef. Ι

Χο11. Mem. 14 ξ 6 τοὺς μὲν πρόσθεν ὀδόντας πᾶσι ζῴοις οἵους τέμνειν εἶναι, τοὺς
δὲ γομφίους οἵους παρὰ τούτων δεξαμένους λεαίνειν. confectio : ‘masti-
cation'.

ξ 135. stomachus 1 here used like πάροχος, which from Homer (11111 292
810.) downwards means the gullet, cf. Ar. H. A.1 12 αὐχὴν τὸ μεταξὺ προσώπου
καὶ θώρακος· καὶ τούτου τὸ μὲν πρόσθιον μέρος λάρυγξ, τό δ’ όπίσθιον στόμαχος,
ib. 16 ό δὲ στόμαχος ἤρτηται μ’ἑν ἄνωθεν derb τοῦ στόματος ἐχόμενοςτῆς ἀρτηρίας
(the trachea), τελευτᾷ δὲ διὰ τοῦ διαζώματος (the diaphragm) εἷς τὴν κοιλίαν,
ie. it is the oesophagus or alimentary canal Hippocrates often uses it for
the neck or upper portion 01 any organ: in later times, as by Meletius Nat.
Hom. c. 18, it is used for the stomach in our sense (ἡ ἅνω κοιλία) as distin-
guished from the oesophagus on the one hand, and the intestines (ἡ κάτω
κοιλία) on the other. cf. Theophilus Oorp. Hem. 11 2 with Greenhill's
note.

tonsillas: apparently so called from impeding the passage 01 10011,
tonsilla being used for the stake to which a boat was fastened, see Festus
. v. ln Greek they were known as παρίσθμια 01, when swollen, as
ἅντιάδες.
