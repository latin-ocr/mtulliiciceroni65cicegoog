great boon has therefore been conferred on the general Englrsh reader by the managers of the

A SKETCH OF ANCIENT PHILOSOPHY FROM

, THALES TO CICERO, by Josnen Β. Maron, Μ.Α., late Professor of
Moral Philosoph at King’s Colle e, London. 3s. 6d.

“ln writing tlns schoiarly aud attractive s etch, Professor Mayor has had chiefl in view
‘undergradnatesat the University or others who are commencing the study of the phiiirsophical
works of Cicero or Plato or Aristotle in the original language,' but also hopes that it ‘may be
found interesting and useful by educated readers generally, not merely as an introduction to the
formal history ot' philosophy,·but ²⁵. supplying aJtey to our present ways of thinking and judging
in “e‘i'arroti‘etsostiiaitlileaiyioorsdiffitiiiiriteekt iilihretafiicti Pr-e-srsmsencsses A Sketclr gf Α ncr'ent Philoso hy in

which he has endeavoured to give a general view of the philoso hleal systems illustratediy the
genius of the masters of metaphysical and ethical science from i'hates to Cicero. In the course
of his sketch he takes occasion to give concise analyses of Plato’s Republic, and of the Ethics and
Politics of Aristotie: and these abstracts will be to some readers not the least usefui portious of

the book. It may be objected against bis design in eneral that ancient philosophy rs too vast
and too deep a subject to be dismissed iu a ‘sketch-that it should be left to those who will make
it a serious study. But that objectiou takes no account of the large class of persons who desire
to know, in relation to reseut discussions and speculations, what famous men in the whole world
thought and wrote on thesatopics. They have not the scholarship which would be necessary for
original examinatlon of authorities: but they have an intelligent interesti n the relations between
ancient and modern hilosophy, arid need just such informatron as Professor Mayor's sketch will
give thern.’'-The uardian.
