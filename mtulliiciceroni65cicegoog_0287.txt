αίρατική, supplied the veins with the blood which it received from the
ααπα caco; and that the left ventricle‚ called πνευματική, supplied the
arteries with the air received from the lunge (Galen Ur. Part. vr 7). 'Phe
course of the air is thus described by Theodoret Prot. p. 514 Scis πνεί·

spiritus per arterias: see nn. on §§ 24 and 136. Accordingtc Sprengel
(1 p. 491) Praxagoras (fl. 300 nc.) first noticed the distinction between
arterias and veins3 in the genuine works of Arist both are coniounded
under the name φλέβες. The reason why it was thought that they con-
tained air was that after death they were found empty while the veins
were filled with the returning blood Galen, while explaining the stronger
texture of the arteries as compared with the veins, from the supposed fect
that the former were intended aa channels ior varying amounts of air,
while the latter had only to convey a uniform amount ot blood, still held
that there was a certain proportion of highly rarefied blood in the arterias,
and of condensed air in the veins (Us.Pcrt.VI10,and 16). It was not
till 1630 Δ, 1). that the true doctrine of the circillation of the blood was
discovered by Harvey.
