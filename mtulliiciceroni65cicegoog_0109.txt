(Tuae. 1 89, rte. 11 61) the grandson followed the family tradition and

*sibyllinis vaticinationibus: the oldest collection of Sibylline pro
phecies is thought to heve been 'made about the time of Solon and pre-
served 01 Erythrae, from whence it was brought to Magna Graecia and tc
Rome. The three ¹books said to have been purchased by Tarquin were
kept in the temple 01 Jupiter Capitolinus under the charge of the au ciri,
and burnt with it 83 Β. 0. After therebuilding, the senate sent to Erythrae
to get a new copy of the prophecies, and we are told that the envoys were
able to collect from private sources about 1000 verses (Lect. 16 ξ 14).

¹ These were again revised under Augustus and Tiberius, and placed in the

temple of Apollo Palatinae, where they were destroyed by fire about400 Α. o.
The Sibylline books were consulted by order of the senate in all emergen-
cies of state, see Liv. v 13, vn 27, &a We learn from Die. 11 110 that
they were written in acrostics (like the 119th ps), which C. regards as a
proof that they did not proceed from an inspired frenzy. See further on

augurum-haruspicum: the anecdote which follows brings out clearly
the contrast between the augins, who were connected with the earliest
history of Rome, and the Etruscan soothsayers. The former were con-
