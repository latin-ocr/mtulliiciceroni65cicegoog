last passage might suggest that O. has confounded cibas (the food taken by
the mother) with 00010010, 111 which case saeptam might referto semea
(=Gr. περιέχεται). Certainly, according to strict Stoic view, the setae
should not have been called caepa animal, as they answered the question

m v 15. Ι1 we keep the reading, Ι should understand it as follows, ‘the

not only the characteristic shape is evolved from the invisssrle central
power, but the material mass itself is acquired by assimilation. The
germinal power 01 the plant transmutas the fixed air and the elementary
base of water into grass and leaves ; and on these the organific principle in
the ox or elephant exercises an alchemy still more stupendous. As the
unseen agency weaves its magio eddies, the foliage becomes indifferently
the bone and its marrow, the pulpy brain or the solid ivory. That what
you see is blood, is flesh, is itseli the work, or shall I say, the translucence
of the invisible energy' dio. 11.] Βο1 Ι am rather disposed to read ea
