BOOK 11 cn. 1111 5114. 235

quem: the Maso. is I think used, not (00 Sch.) because C. had 11110111
in his mind (on which see Varro a. a. 1 12), but because in the Ρ11001. he
had used 101 11 the name Eridanus, of which 1100010(1.149)111110 01111111

made out to be that on which the Gods swore alliancc against the Titane.

because (l) 110 should otherwise have 001111-10111111-001111 all meaning the
same thing (for 1010111 can hardly be taken in the sense of ‘stretch’ with
porgens just before), (2)1110 idea of sacrifice is naturally suggested by the
altar, (3) the word 1101101111, which does not occur in the original, seems
to have been added by cic. to suit 0000111 rather than 000111. ’
