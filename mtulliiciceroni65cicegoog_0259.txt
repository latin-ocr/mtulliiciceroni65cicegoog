εἰσενόησα θῆρας ὁμοῦ tucn«, cf. too Od. xl 310, v 21. In oriental
astronomy he is the giant Nimrcd, see Smith's Dect. os tta Brlrle under
‘Orion'. The story of his death lor insulting Diana is variously told;
according to one account it was through the sting of a scorpion (see ,
above ξ 109 on Nepa), according to another followed by Horace, actus

et iruegrae temptator θννονι Βιανιαο virgineo domitm myrtea (Od. 111 4
70).

altered from refulgens cf Pleneu to suit the context. Sirim rose at the
time cf the cntry cf the sun into bec, which marked the hottsst season of
the year3 hence Horace speaks cf rabiem Osset et musca ἀοοτιιὲι, cum
muel occepit solem macru nemum ; Ep.110 16. Homer (Il. xm 29)
likens Achilles to the baleful star ὅντε κύν’ Ὠρίωνος ἐπίκλησιν καλέουσιν.

post Lepus subsequitur: Aratus 338 nooott’ ἀρ’ Ὠρίωνος ὑπ’ ἀμφι»
τέροισι Λαγῳὸο ἐμμενές ἤματα πάντα διώκετον αὐτὰρ ὅ γ’ αἰεὶ Σείριος ἐξόπιθεν
φέρεται μετιόντι ἐοικός. The mythologists were hard put to it tc find any
story for this constellation, which, like the hound, ths doves and others,
was simply seen in the sky by the primitive hunters. A moral is attached
to it, as to the Hydra, by Hyginus 11 33.

curriculum sedans: this is said of Sirius in Pisaea. 125, bnt itis more
like the original tc make it refer, us here, to the Hare.

at Oanis-Asso: the original is cited above on posteriore trahens.
On the Argo see § 89. serpens may express the gliding movement either
of a ship or of the heavenly bodies, as in Pham. 45 (Ales) colet 'et saperes
gemines secat cers ρίοοίε, and Luor. v 690 conco sol ι’τι quo concludet
tempora serpens.

hanc Aries tegit: here, as above (quem propter), the noun to which
the pronoun refers has been omitted, either from a hiatus in the Mss or from
carelessness on the part cf C, see Arat. 356 Κῆτος ὑπὸ Κριῲ τε καὶ Ἰχθύσιν
ἀμφοτέροισι βαιὸν ὑπὲρ Ποταμοῦ βεβλημένον ἀστερόεντος : thus turned by O.
Phoco. 140 Andromedam explorasse fero quaerere Pistris pergit...lranc Artes
&e As the verse stands herc, we are obliged to refer beaw to Argo, which
really lies 70⁰ to the west of Cetus cr Pistris. This was supposed to be
the sea monster sent to devour Andromeda For Aries and Pisces see
above p 111. tegit, lor which Soh. conjectures tagit, simply means lies
above it, ie. to the north of it.

fluminis—ripas: the River is, according tc Aratus, the mysterious
Eridanus, identified by many with Pedes ; others supposed it to be the
Nile. illustri: Orelli conjectured illrestrts as nearer the original ἀστε-
ρόεντος, but the epithet suits one noun as well us the other, and the Abla·
tivc makes a better verse. Sch. reads tangentes without rcas0n3 Cetus
, does touch the River with his breast,-I adopt Heinsius' emendation,
pectore for corpore-while Pisces arc some distance from it.
