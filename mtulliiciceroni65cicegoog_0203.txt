Holden on Off1147‚end Dumesnil on Ley. 11 26. Ο. repeets here what
he had said Leg. 1122611116 Verte is a borrowcd word, but 16 is merely en
off-shoot of the same root 1111160 which both ατο and αὕω belong. eunius
in his later editions distinguishes this root from vis ‘bo dwell’ from which
derv is derived. Another etymology is given by Ovid Fae. vl 399 etot ri
terra eea, ri stando l'eeta recator, which reminds one of that ol Ἐστία from
ἑστάναι 111 Cornutus.

111 ea dea omnis sacrificatio extrema est=eetremo pore menfica
tiorn'e eet τίι ejoe deae veneratione, Sch. The rare word sacr. is also found
Moerob. Sat. 1 ἰ’ § 35, Τοτ61111. Idol. 9. The evidence in favour ofreligious
services being closed with the name of Vesta, as they commenoed with
that of J nnus, is not very strong, see Preller p. 546. On the other hnnd
the proverb ἀφ’ Ἑστίας ὅρχεσθαι (rutupi p. 3, Verp. 842 with erdod,
Cratryl. 401 βούλει σύν ἀφ’ Ἑστίας ἀρχώμεθα κατὰ τὸν νόμον, and a 116610
below τὸ γὰρ πρδ πόντων θεῶν τῇ Ἐστία πρώτῃ προθύειν εἶκδο ἐκείνους οἵ
τινες τὴν πάντων odaiae Ἐστίαν ἐπωνόμασαν) shows the usage 111 the classical
time of Greece. In the Homeric hymn x1x 6 she is worshipped last as
well as 11186,ούγδρι’ίτερ σοῦ εἶλαπίναι θνητοῖσιν, ἵν’ σύ πρώτῃ πυμότῃ τε
Ἱστίῃ ἀρχόμενος σπένδει μελιηδέα οἶνσν; and so Cornutus 28 μυθεύεται
πρώτη καὶ ἐσχάτη γενέσθαι τῷ εἷς ταύτην (as the earth) ἀναλύεσθαι τδ ὄπ’
αὐτῆς γινόμενα καὶ ἐξ αὐτῆς ξυνίστασθαι’ καθὸ κόν ταῖς θυσίαις σί Ἕλληνες
ἀπὸ πρώτης τε αύτῆς ἤρχοντο καὶ εἷς ε’σχότην αὐτὴν κατέπαυον. Ovid (Fosi.
vr 303) follows Plato, inde precando praefamur Vectem, qnae loeo prima
tenet, which shows at any rahe that the idea of the end being secred 6ο
Veste was dying out.

§ 68. Penates: eunius connects 61111 gods of the shore (ρσιαε) 111611
poscor pabulum, and refers pereites perterrebo the seme root. Servius (on
Aee. xr 211) calls the foces the ανον Penatium, and Virgil (Aere. 1 704) uses
the phrase adolere Penates in the sense of keeping up the fire: see Preller
p. 532 foll. and Gell. Iv 1.

penetrales vocantur: ef. anull. 69 ad qoem ιιι-ιιι properans serenior

Apollo: on the introduction of his worship from Cumae into Rome,
see Preller (pp. 130 and 266), who connects 16111611 611ο admission of the
Sibyllino books under Tarquin. The oraclo at Delphi was consulted by
the Romans in 61111 early years of the republic, Apollo was known 6ο them
from the beginning as the god of healing: his first temple was built 429 nc. ‚

Solem esse volunt: so Eurip. Praete. fr. 775 ὦ καλλιφεγγὲς ‘Hir’ τίς

ὀνόματ’ οἶδε δαιμόνων, and Plato Orat. 405, who derives the namo Ἀπόλλων
from ἅμα πυλῶν signifying τὴν ὁμοῦ πόλησιν καὶ περὶ τὸν ούρανδν...κα1 περὶ
τὴν ἐν τῇ ῴδῃ όρμονίαν...ὅτι ταῦτα πόντα, oie φασιν οἱ κομψοὶ περὶ μουσικὴν

philosophers were probably right in identiiying Apollo 111611 the god of '
