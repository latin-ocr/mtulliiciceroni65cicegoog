orum) with the Epicurean κατ’ εἰδώλων ἐμπτώσεις. 'ibe air was equally
important according 1ο both theories, cf. Lucr. 1v nlo-323 ‘an image
pushes before it the air between it and the eye: this air sweeps through
the pupil and lets us judge of the distance of the object ’, ‘thus the mirror
and its distance from us is seen by means of its image which propels
before it the air between the mirror and the eye, then when wehave caught
sight of the minor, the image which goes from us to it, comes back 1ο us
but drives onward an air whichis perceived before the image' is qaoque

to have been the first to assign this importance to air as the means
of producing sensation: his view is more allied to the Stoic than to the
Epicurean, cf. Theoph. de Seruo 39 Διογένης δέ, ὥσπερ τὸ ζῆν καὶ τὸ φρο-

nobiscum audit: all philosophare (except Epicurus, cn whom see
Lucr. 1v san-614, Dicg. x 53) agreed in this (see Pac. Phil. 1v 16), but
they differed as to the way in which sound was produced by air, whether it
was by external air or interna] air or both together (as Diogenes held), of.
