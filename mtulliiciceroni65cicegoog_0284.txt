cibus animalis—animantes: ‘that eerial nutriment which is the
chief support of animal life ’, cf. Hippoc. de evat. 4 ‘the body is sueteined
by three kinds of nutriment σῖτα ποτὰ πνεύματα, of which the lestis by fer
the most important'. Arist. denies this (Respo. 6) ἀλλὰ μὴν οὐδὲ τροφῆς

only use is to cool the heart Galen (Ur. Part. vn 9) on the other hand
considers that the chief functiones respiration is to keep up the vital heat
by constant supplies of fresh air, and indly to feed the vital spirit (τὸ
ψυχικὸν πνεῦμα). ’ The word cibiae is used below 111 37 01 the exhalatione on

ξ 137. Oicaro's account of the process of digestionis very incorrect.
The following is a summary of what is said in Huxley's Ptyn'oloyy on the
subject. The foed when it has passed into the stomach is changed by
continual rolling about with constant additions of gastris juiee‚ into a
fluid called chycce, of which a considerable portion is absorbed through the
walls of the vessels of the stomach into the current cf tha blood, which is
rushing through the gastric veins to the oeae portae. The remainder ofthe
chyme pasees into the decedentem, where it is mixed with bile and pancreatic
juice and becomes style. In its passage through the smaller intestines the
greater portion of this is again carried off through the capillaries into the
blood vessels: the remainderis absorbed by thelacteal vessels, and conveyed
through these to the mesenteric glande, and thence to the thoracic duct,
where it is compounded with lymph. It is then carried to the subclavian
vein, which sends the blood into the right sido of the heart. From thence
it is conveyed by the pulmonary artery to the lunge, where it is converted
into arterial blood. See diagrams in Huxley or elsewhere.

not properly an intestine at cll, but a membrano interposed between the
intestines (ὑπὲρ τῶν ἐντέρων, Arist. says H. A. 116), ‘a fold of the peri-

abdomen ', Huxley l. c. p. 36. It is however classed among the intestines

portas jecoris: the ‘portal fissure' where the vena portae, the hepatic
ariery and the great nerves enter the liver. Galen (Ua. Part. 1v 1) tells us
that after the stomach has cleared away the grosser particles, it sende the
chyle to the liver (κοινὸν ὅλου τοῦ ζῴον πέψεως χωρίον), the entrance to
which, being divided into many narrow passages, has received the name
πύλαι, originally given by ἀνήρ τις παλαιὸς δεινός, οἶμαι, περὶ τὴν φύσιν,
