SOURCES OF THE SECOND BOOK. XXl

induced Hirzel (Uutcvsrchuayaa zu Cicero’s philosophisclrca Schriften
1 191-244) to assign a number of different authorities for the
different parts of Oicero’s book. Iu the first place Oicero writes to
Atticus (Ate. xm 8) in June 45 aa, the year before the N.D.
appeared, asking for an epitome of the writings of (laelius by Brutus,
and for Panaetius περὶ προνοίας. Must we¹ not suppose that he asksd
for them with the intention of using thern for the book which he was
then preparing, especially as we find that he quotes from Caelius in
ξ 8, and as he chose Panaetius as his authority in the first two books
of the Dc Officiis? Much that has been said iu favour of the cluims
of Posidonius is also applicabis to Panaetius. He wrote u good style,
was an admirer of Plato and Aristotle, and departed on many points
from the rigid dogmatism of the older Stoics. We are not told how-
ever that he paid much attention to scisnce, and there are certainly
parts of this second book which could not possibly have been derived
from him. For instance Divination is defended in ἐξ 7-12 and
again in 162, 163, but we know from Cicero himself Diu. 1 12, 11 88,
97, as well as from other writers (see Zeller ιν p.- 567), that Panae·
tius was u disheliever in divination 3 Schiche and Hartfslder even
suppose his treatise περὶ προνοίας to have been the authority used by
Cicero for the second book of his de divinatione, in which the nega-
tive side issupported. Again the immortality, or rather the eternity
of the soulis maintained in 562, but, as we see from the Tuccabor
(1 42, 78), this was entirely rejected by Panaetius Alsothe manner
in which his opinion in regard to the Cyclic Conflagration is referred
to is inconsistent with the idea that Cicero could have been there
copying from him. Still there is the fact that Oicero was studying
his περὶ προνοίας at the time when he was engaged on his own book
on the subject. But so also he was studying Phaedrus περὶ θεῶν,
when¹ writing about the Epicurean theology, and yet we have seen
reason to believe that his authority for that portion of his treatise was
not Phaedrus, but Zeno, see vol. 1 p. xarv foll. If Cicero used Pa-
naetius for his treatise ou Divination, which is merely a sequsl to the
N. D, this would be quite sufficient explanation for his request to
Atticus, but he may also have thought of getting further material
either for his exposition or for his criticism of the Stoic doctrine on
Provideucs. Hirzel however is of opinion that the second book
shows signs of having been compiled from different sources, and that
while oue part is taken from Posidonius, another part is from Apollo
