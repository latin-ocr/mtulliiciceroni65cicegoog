probable that there has been further loss in the uss, and that the original
may have been something like at aa fovea obsonant et er inopinato, ον’ quid
iaudat, δια, or er iusidias observant, at ου inopinate, ai quid ίυοήοίονήί, arat-
μέσον. It is possible however to take οδιοιυανιί et arripiunt as asort of
hendiadys‚ so as to allow the force of αο iuop. to extend to the ind word.

pina: cf. niu. 11163 (some beasts are solitary) ut ma quae ιἰι corula
patula ρίαα dieitur, isque qui enat e οοαοΙια, qui, αμοοί euni custodit, pino
teres οοοοίινν, ίαοοιιθονηηυο eum se recepit includitur, ut uideatur manaurae ut
caueret...aliorum eausa quaedam facium. Aristotle saysthat the pes-crab
(aquilla, πιννοτήρης) finds alodging in the shell oi the ‘naker' or mussel
(πίννη) and that the latter dies, if separated from the former (II. A. v 15).
So Chrysippus (ap. Athen. ΙΙΙ c. 38) ἐν τῷ πέμπτῳ περὶ τοῦ καλοῦ καὶτῆς
adornari πίννη, φησὶ, καί ὁ πιννοτήρης συνεργὰ ἀλλήλοις,“ κατ’ ίδίαν od δυνά-
μενα συμμένειν...ή πίννη διαστήσασα τὸ ὄστρακον ἡσυχάζει τηροῦσα τὰ ε’πει-

In the Εαρίιὲθι θμοίοραοθία there is a letter to Linnaeus from a eorre-
spondent at Smyrna dated 17493 in whioh the latter says ‘the Pinna muri·
οανο or Great Silk Mussel is here found at the bottom of the sea in large
quantities, being a foot long. The Ὀκτωπόδια or Cuttle-fish with eight
>arms watches the opportunity, when the mussel opens her shell, to creep
in and devour her; but a little crab, which has soarcely any shall, lodges
constantly in this shall-fish3 she pays a good rent by saving the life of her
landlady, for she keeps a constant look-out through the aperturos of the
shall, and on seeing the enemy approaoh ”she begins to stir, when the
πίνα (for so the Greeks eall the shell) shuts up her house, and the rapacious
animal is exeluded. I saw this shall-bsh first at the island of Milo and
found such a little crab in all I opened. Iwondered not a little what was
her business there, but when I came here, I was first informed of it by the
secretary of our consul, acurious and ingenious man, who has lived long
in this place. This was afterwards confirmed by several Greeks, who daily

oatch and eat both these animals’.
