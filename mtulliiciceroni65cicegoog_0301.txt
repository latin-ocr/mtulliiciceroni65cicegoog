writers the Dat. is chiefly used, see Madv. Gr. 219 oba 2. We finda
similar combination after erpere, Sall. carrea plerique pateriae, amaea sama

molles commissuras et artus: hendiadys ‘the' flexibility of the
joints'. Perhaps we may distinguish commissero as denoting particularly
the cartilaginous lining of the joint [and artas as the joints of the fingere,
ie. the three small bones of which each finger is made up. R.].

admotione digitorum: no other en ol this word is cited before 400 ala,
but in Brea. 200 we read calmis jadicem admovere oratrbaera tamquam
fidibus monam, which might suggest that it was a technical word lor
musical ‘fingering'.

carving, music.
