‘⁸ Mr Reid isso well known to scholars as a commentator on Cicero that a new work from him
scarcely needt any commendation os ouis. His edition of the speech Pro Sulla is sully e nal in
inerit to the volumes which he has already published . . . It would be difficult to speak too ighiy
os the notes. There could be no better way of aining an insight into the characteristics of
Cicero's st le and the Latinity os his periodthangby making a careful study οξ this speech with
the aid of Mi Reid's commentary . . . Mr Reid's intimate knowledge oi the minutest details of
scholarship enables him to detect and explain the slightcst points ot' distinction between the
usages oi different authors and different periods. . ,The notes are followed by a valuable
appendix on the text, and another on points ol orthography; an excellent index brings tlie work
to a close.''-Saturday Revr'ew.

volume is neatly got up, and is in every way commendante.''- The Scotsman.
