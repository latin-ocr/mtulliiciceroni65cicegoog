Oh. xxvr ξ 66. aer-J uronis nomine consecratur: the Greek mytho
logers considered Ἦρα to be another form of ἀήρ, ag. Plato Oratyl. 404 ἴσως
δέ μετεωρολογῶν ό νομοθέτης τόν α’έραἭραν αίνόμασεν έπικρυτττόμενος, θείς τὴν
ἀρχὴν ε’πὶ τελευτίην· γνοίης δ’ όν, εί πολλάκις λέγοις τό τῆς Ἥρας ὄνομα (like
the αὐτομολῶμεν of the Equites) cf. Groto Plato 11516f011. The elemento had
been previously deified by Epicharmus cited by M. Mllller p. 3935 μέν Ἐτί-
χαρμος τούς θεοὺς εἶναι λέγει ἀνέμους ὕδωρ γῆν ἥλιον πῦρ ἀστέρας, and by Empe-
docles Piae. Phil. 13 τέσσαρα τῶν πόντων ῥιζώματα πρῶτον όκουε· Ζεύς ἀργός
Ἥρη τε φερέσβιος ηδ’ Αίδωνεύς Νῆστίς dni δακρύοις τέγγει, κρούνωμα βρότειον,
thus explained by the epitomator, Δία μέν γόρ λέγει τήν ζέσιν καὶ τόν αι’θέρα,
Ἥρην δέ τόν ἀέρα, τὴν δέ γῆν τόν Αίδωνέα, Νῆστιν δέ καί κρούνωμα βρότειον,
οἱονεὶ τὸ σπέρμα καὶ τὸ ὕδωρ z others however identified Ἦρα with earth
and Αἰδωνεύς with air, see Stura Empori. p. 209 foll. The Stoics followed
in the same line, see Cornutus c. 3, Diog. L. v11 147 with nn, Heracl
Alleq. p. 429 Gale, δύο γὰρ όντων κατὰ τοὺς φυσικούς τῶν πνευματικῶν

diuidi ia duur partes, caelum et terram et caelum bifariam ia cethem et αονω,·
terram vero ia aquam et humum...an omnes partes animarum esse platos.

interjectus inter mare et caelum : on the order of the four elementa
see §y ae, ιν, 101, 117.

et similitudo est aeri aetheris et cum eo conjunctio: the edd change
the first et into ei after Probus, Ithink both are needed: J uno issister
and therefore like, wife and therefore united. Also it seems to me there
would be awkwardness in ei and eo referring to different subjecte. I have
ventured to insert aeri before oettais, as Mu. has done 1 103. It is to a
certain extent in favour of this emendation, that Probus has aeris instead
of cethaea The Dat. is of course dependent on est, as in Lep. 1 25 est
iyiteu iorniai cam deo similitudo.

sed ‹lunonem-nominatam: this clause is questioned by Baiter,
Stamm (Ιιυοιροί. p. 33) and Vauoher; but it is preserved by Probus, and I
see no particular objection to it. It would be strange ifthe etymology
were wanting in the case of Juno alone. I take red to introduce an
incidental remark like autem or δέ, ‘by the way'; not (es Degenhart p.
65) to denote the opposition between the physioal derivation of Ἥρα and
the non-physical derivation of ‘J uno ². Perhaps Allen is right in inserting
item afterJaaoaem. Credo implies that Cio. is not quite certain as to the
etymology, which he has borrowed from Varro L. L. v 67.

[The stem Jaaoa is in Roman vowels jdv-in-on, in primitive jaro-oa-aa.
The first syllable is seen in Jov-ia Δι-ός (εΔιΡ-ος) ; the second as well as
the first in Δι-ών-η, Dida-a, Ζᾱν (εΔι-αν), ιῘ-ᾶιυυς (the old or Doric α
correspondingas often, to ω), and also jair-iaia, jeta-ior, βαίνουσα re·
minding one of βοῶπις Ἦρα and of the uso of heifers in the ritas of J uno.
