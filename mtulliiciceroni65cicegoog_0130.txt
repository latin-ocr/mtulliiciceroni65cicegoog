· tained 011 the subject 01 011100 in the Plac. Ptil. 111 17 (πῶς ἀμπώτιδες
·γι’νονται καὶ πλημμῦριιι); Aristotle and Heraclitus say the tides are pro-

· duced by 0110 0011, which is the exoiting cause of winds3 these when they

1100 push the sea before·them and cause it to swell, when they sink the
sea falls back into its place. Pytheas (the famous traveller 01 Μο001110
110. 300, see Bunbury Aac. Geoy. 1 p. 600) says the tide rises when the
moon is waxing and sinks as it wanes; Plato, that there is a kind c'f
natmal 01100100101101 0110 waters 01 0110 sea (the reference 10 tc the de·
scription 01 0110 rivers of Tartarus, Plioedo p. 111); Timaeus, that the
tides ’01 0110 000011 010 caused by the violent torrente 01 Gaul; Seleucus
(cf. Plut. Ploo. Quart. p. 1006) that they proceed from the contrary cur?
rents of air 'generated by the rotation cf the earth and the moon. Bunbury
writes as follows (11 97) ‘Posidonius (O.’s chief authority in this book)
appears to have been the first Greek writer that arrived at clear ideas
about the tides For this he was indebted tc his journey tc Spain, where
he spent 001110 time at Gades, and from 1110 own observation, coupled with
the information he received from the natives, acquired a distinct know-
ledge not only 01 0110 diurna] recurrence 01 0110 011100, 1100 01 011011 monthly
cyclcs 01 variaticn, which 110 correctly ascribed to the influence 01 0110Ι
moon, and its different positione with 'regard to 0110 sun ; 00 that the
highest tides, as he observed, always coincided with the full moon and
the lowest with the half-moon or intermediate quarter', 01. Strabo 1113
p. 229, 5 p. ael-264, where he-tells us that Aristotle had referred the
tides tc the peculiar nature of the Spanish coast, but that Pos. rightly
maintained τήν τοῦ Ὠκεανοῦ κίνησιν ὑπέχειν άστεραειδῆ περίοδον, τὴν μὲν ·
ἡμερήσιον α’παδιδαῦσαν, τὴν δέ μήνιαῐαν, τὴν δ’ ένιαυσιαῖον, συμπαθῶς τῇ σελήνῃ.
Strabo (11 p. 9) 01110110 Homer referred tc this in 1110 ἀψόῤῥοος Ὠκεανός and
the description of Charybdis. Though the true theory 01 011100 had thus
been established early in the first century Β, 0. yet we find later writers still
dcubting as 00 011011 cause, e. g. Lucan 1 412, 00 to whether they are due tc
> the wind or tc the moon, Pomp. Mela (time 01 00119110) 111 1 as to whether ·
theymay not be due to the respiration 01 the mundane animal. The

· early Stoice, 111 01110 agreeing with the Epicureans, thought the subject
