function it is, as repones, ‘the survivor’ (lit. the friend who bends over
the dying mun: or had supersto originally the force of supersunt? cf. presto),
to do proper honours to the dead and carry out his wishes &a One who
was to an excessivo degree occupied with the thought of the dead and was
held to be in close intercourse with the unseen world was superstitibsus,
either a necromaneer and wizard, or a ioolish believer in ghosts, accord-
ing to the degree of enlightenment in surrounding society.

religiosi exrelegendo: G.’s derivation is supported by the old verse
preserved by Gellius 1. e. seligentem 1111 eportet, religiosum nefus, and is
favoured by Curtius s. 1. λέγω, who compares θεῶν -ὅπιν οὐκ ἀλέγοντες
(Il. 1111388); but here too Lactantius (1v 28) seems to me right, nonren

pretatur est, gnie uit religionum se nodos exsoluere (1932). See Munro on
Luor. 1 109, who cites 111 1111110105 nisi etiurn rnuliehibus religionibus te
implicuisses, as proving that O. himself could not help connecting the word
with the idea of obligation: so we find religione obstringere (2 Phil. 83); solui

tures p. 11) is inclined to prefer O.’s etymology 011 the ground that there is
no truce of the religious sense in the use of the verb religare (except in
Lact. l. c.); but it may be replied that neither is there in relegere, except in
passages which are intended to prove the connexion With these excep-
tions we do not get nearer than Trojuui belli scriptorem relegi Hor. epp.

elegantes ex eligendo: Stamm rightly says (p. 35) thatthis clause,
which is omitted by some uss aud edd. is needed to justify the following
erunibus, which could hardly be used of less than three clauses. Elegans
seems to show that the root leg had two conjugatioual forms, us the root
lig must have had if we derivo religio from it: M. Mtill. lc.·oompares
lictor and the double forms implied in opinio and rebellio by the side
of opinari, rebellari. For the sense ef. 111111 Inuum 49, electissima uerba

‘careful', ‘attentive'.
