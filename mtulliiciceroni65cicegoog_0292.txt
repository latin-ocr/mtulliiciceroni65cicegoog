Boon 11 cu. nvn ξ 142. 267

aciesque: the que here has the force of porro, es in ξ 145 omnisque
sensae. Δρίος ‘the point of the eye' is used for ρυριιίο by Lucr. 111
408-414.

pupula: from ρνηναεκόρη. Cf. Plat Ale. Ι p. 133 ἐννενόηκας οὖν ότι
τοῦ ἐμβλέποντος εἷς τὸν ὀφθαλμόν τὸ πρόσωπον ἐμφαίνεται ε’ν τῇ τοῦ καταν-
τικρὺ ὄψει, ῶσπερ ε’ν κατόπτρῳ, ό δὴ καί κόρην καλοῦμεν, εἴδωλον όν τοῦ
ἐμβλέποντος;

mollissimae tastu-aptissime saetae sunt: Heind's addition ιιιιι .
seems to me necessary. Even then ἠόα sentence is awkward, as well es
inharmonious from the recurrenee of sounds.

providit: se. ηαήυνο, understood with some difficulty after the inter-
vening clauses, [but assisted by saetae in ἠόα line before. R.].

ξ 143, palpebrae: οἱ Xen. Mem. 14(Is not this also a sign of provi-
dentia] care) τό ε’πεί ἀσθενὴς μέν ε’στιν ἦ ὄψις, βλεφάροις αὐτὴν θυρῶσαι, ά, Ι
ὅταν μὲν αὐτῇ χρῆσθαί τι δέη, ἀναπετάννυται, ἐν δὲ τῷ ὕπνῳ συγκλείεται ,· ῶςδ)

φότεραι βοηθείας χάριν εἶσίν, αἱ μὲν όφράες τῶν καταβαινόντων ὑγρῶν, όπως

τῶν πρὸς τά ὄμματα προσπιπτόντων ἕνεκεν, οἷον τὰ χαρακώματα (cfl vallo
piletum) ποιοῦσί τινες πρὸ τῶν ἐργμάτων.

vello: ‘epelieade made by the stooks of young trees with their lateral
branehes shortened end sherpened αή ἠόα point so as to form a sort of
οάοοωιαι de frate, usually planted by the Greeks and Romans on the outer
edge of the mound of earth (αρραν) thrown up ae a rampart round their
eamps’ Rieh Οοιιιροιιιίοιι &e.; el Saea. 51 (the eorn) οοιιινο aviam οιοναιιι
mombar uallo aristolaus. Similarly Theodoret (Ρνου. 111 p. 525 Sehnlze) ’
compares ἠόα eyeleshes to δόρατα καὶ βελη and shortly afterwards to stokes
(σκόλοπας), and illustratos their use by ἠόα boarded wheat which is pro-
teoted from ἠόα birds by its bristles

quibus-quiescerent: ἠόα general sense is es follows, ‘the eyelids
are guerded with a ιΙιαυαυα de frose of heire, both to repel anything
which might impinge upon ἠόα eyes when open, and as it were ἠο tuok
them in when closed in sleep’, but this is expressed with extreme awk-
wardness. Even assuming with Brieger (Βιιήτάρα aar area d. eaeo,
Posen 1873) that ιιή qui is e oonuption arising out of ἠόα repetition of the
last syllable of ιἰιινοήιιήιΙ and ἠόα first of quiescerem, we heve still the
ablativos oooioemaa and oealir, where we ought ἠο heve the subject of the
verb ρυιαιοινιπι. Soh thinks an original coniventes has been assimileted to
opertio by the scribes, and that ooalo'e is repeated instead of io‘e, as we heve
ιἰι temo ξ 25; Brieger supposes thet the original had uobis minemibooey
end, if we are required to make sense of the passage, es it stands, (alter
omitting at qao) Ι think we must, at any rete in thought, supply ηοόήι.
