heaven ’, comparing the construction of καταρᾶοριιι in the epigram tv τιν’
ἔχῃς ἐχθρὸν, Διονύσιε, μὴ καταρᾶσῃ τῆνἸσιν τούτῳ. It does 1101 000111 that
we have any ex. of easeeror used in this sense or with Dat.; it is found
absolutely Pare.1107 exsecratur epact Enniam Thyestes at pereat Atreus,
and within and Ace. or with Ace. alone, 'a g. exsecror te, or exsecratur
e‘a se Liv. x 28, xxx 20. Kiihner translates ‘that 10 which I will devote
all my powers is this shining veult, whatever its name'; Sch. agrees in
thinking that exsecror may have this force, ‘to consecrate one thing out of
allother things ', but adds no translation. Vahlen and Ribbeck read aar
forcai referring 10 Hartunngr.ltest.1153; this seems to me improbable
with the strong phrase paedia me eat. Reading qai (Abl.) Ι translate
‘Wherefore with all my might Iwill curse this shining heaven ². MrRoby
remarks that such words would be natural in the mouth 01 Thyestes, and
that the preceding fragment is taken from the play of that name.

Jove fulgente: cf. Dia.1142 11011110 perspiaaam est, ea petrea admira-
tione 1011111100, 011001 1011111110 jactatque falmtaam extimuisset, credidere ea

dicunt-tonante: ifthis is not a gloss, we have dabam used in the
sense of ‘mean’‚ as in reticerem dieo ξ 18, solem dieo t 80, not as imme-
diately before.

ut multa praeclare: cf. below} 79 camarae, at malta.

breviter: is plainly inappropriate here. Some have suggested praviter.
Ba. refers 10 Dia11107 festiae et tracter, but there terseness is the con-
spicuous quality 01 the preceding argument: here the lines of Euripides
are wordy in comparison with that of Ennius. The same may be said of
the exx. cited by Mu (Fleckeisea’s Jahrb. 1864 p. 134) Lep.1123‚ Ac. 143,
aaa. 14, Fronto p. 254 Nieb. omnem aeatatte'am 1110011ον et scite eoa
eludet. I think Heind is right in considering it 10 be a marginal note
calling attention tc the abbreviation of the formula Jaae fialpeate aem
papale api rasas. ,

vides sublime fusum: translated from an unknown play of which this
fragment is fortunately preserved, ὁρᾷς τὸν ὑψοῦ τόνδ’ ἄπειρον αἰθέρα καὶ
γῆν πέριξ ἔχονθ’ ὑγραῖς ἒν ἀγκάλαις· τοῦτον νόμιζε Ζῆνα, τόνδ’ ἦγον θεόν
(11. 836). Paley (Itbnp. 1 p. xxviii) gives other passages in which Eur.
deifies ether. The translation is probably by O. Herod. (1 131) says the
· Persians τὸν κύκλον πάντα τοῦ οὐρανοῦ Διά καλοῦσιν.

immoderatum: Lucr. 1 1013 simplice actara pateat taatea immode-
