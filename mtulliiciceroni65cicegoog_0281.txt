not because it is ‘rough in the interior' (L. and S. s. v. arteria), for Arist.
(Part. Au. 1113) assigna, as a reason for its being composed ἐκ χονδρώδους
σώματος, that δεῖ τὸ ψοφήσεεν μέλλον λεῖον εἶναι καὶ στερεότητα ἔχειν ; but
because ‘it is strengthened by a series of from 16 to 20 horizontal cartila-
ginous rings’‚ which can be felt in the throat, and is thus distinguished
from the smooth tube which constitutus a common artery. Erasistratus
(fl. 280 sc.) is said to have been the first to use the distinctive epithet.
The word ἀρτηρία (connected with ἀείρω, ἀορτήρ· properly means ‘suited for
suspending', and is fitly used for that from which the lungs and other vitel
parts are suspended, and by which they are held up when the animal is
opened after death: hence Sophocles calls it πνεύμονος ἀρτηρίας Trauli. 1054
‘suspendere of the lungs ' (the plural is used for the two bronchial tubes). In
like manner the tube or cord from which the heart is suspended is called
ἆορτη, cf. Arist. H. A. Ι 16 ἐξήρτηται (τὸ μεσεντέριον) ε’κ τῆς μεγάλης φλεβὸς καὶ
τῆς ἀορτης, &o In Aristotle’s genuine writings we find ἀρτηρία used only of
the windpipe, but by later writers itis also employed (sometimes with the
distinctiva epithet λεία) for the artery in our sense. 'llhis extension of
meaning was probably due to the idea that the artery was an air-tube like
the windpipe, see below ξ 138 spiritus per ortatus (diffunditur); whence
some derived the name from delpand τηρεῖν ¹(Theophilus Oorp. Η um. ed.
Greenhill pp. 296, 297 n). For the subject matter we may compare Gell.
