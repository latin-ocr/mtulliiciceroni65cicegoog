σαρκάδης, ἔχων νευράδη τάσιν· νευράδηο μέν, ὅπως ἔχη διάτασιν εῑσιοάσηο τῆς
τροφῆς, so Ochus 1v 1 l 14 (using the word ιιονιαιΙιιιι in the sense of O.'s
dces) says ιιονιαιΙιιιι qai ιἰιοιιιινιονιιιιι praecpitem ert, ιιιινοιιιι ιι septima
apinae cenebra incepit.

multiplex et tortuosa: describing the smaller intestines. The same
words are found combined in a metaphorica] sense Laet. 65.

arcetque et continet: conjoined in a. P. v1 17 orbis cariore arcera et
ceruicem ιιιινοι, the former word brings into greater prominence the idea
of a restraining and limiting force from the outside.

calore quem multum hebet: cf. above j 24. Theophilus corp. Ηιινι.
11 4 says that ‘since the stomach needed abundant hcat, the Creator
placed near it the liver' ὥσπερ λέβητα διάπυρον. 011 the attraction of the
epithet into the relative clause, see Draeg. j 474„

et terendo cibo: Madv. omitted ciba· but, clumsy as the phrase is, we
could hardly dispensa with the object here, and the gerund by itself would
come in a little awkwardly between the substantivas celere and ιρινιδιι.
Heind reads er tercado, ‘heat arising from the crushing of food'; but
color and ιιιιιινα are two distinct causes of digestion, which were opposed
to one another by rival medical schools, as we leam from Celsus 1 procera,
dece aiii Ιδναοιιιιανο, teri cibem ιἰι νιιιινι ceruendum ,·...ιιῑιί’ credunt Hippo-
crati ριν calorem cibos concoqui.

Oh. nv. raritas quaedam—mollitudo ε ‘oia loose and spongy consist-
ency'. Quaedam is added because rariter was an unusual word perhaps first
employed by O: even rores is generally used of distinct objecta rather than
of one loosely constituted whole. The word sporryiosce is used by Oelsus
1v 1 prdrw ιροιιρὶοιιιι ideoque spirea ιοροιι, instead of O.’s periphrasis3
cf. Plato Tim. 70 the lung hae inside σήραγγας (centies) οἷον στάγγον κατα-
τετρημένας, Arist. Pari. Art. 111 troppis ά πλεύμων καὶ ὅμοιος ἇφρῷ.

aspirantes: properly used of blowing upon some external object, as
above ξ 83 aspiratio aeris ‘ventilatiou'‚ here absolute, of an expiratiom
which would be more properly expressed bya reference to the termium a
qao, but the word exspiro is not found in Caesar or cio: perhaps its later
connotation unfitted it for use in the literal sense.

tum iu respiraro: Lamh's emend. for territare spirite. The word
respiro is used for the general process of breathing‚ like ἀναπνεῖν, but also
specially for the retium of breath in either direction3 as just above we
had respiret et reddet opposed to crimem qaae decta ceroptata, and again
below j 138 redditur respirem but here (as in J uv. x1v 28 ιιι rura ter
decies respiret) of drawing in bresith, in response to the outgoing breath of
aspirantes. So ἀναπνοή is opposed 1οέκπνοή in Plato Tim. 79 a, Arist
Part. Ao. 111 3. The corruption of the uss was hardly to be avoided, when
once re had got separated from the rest of the word, not to mention that
respiratus is very rare, apparently only found elsewhere in Apuleius,
Medus emend iatrcate spirate is unsatisfactory, because it represents the
organ as passively influenced by the breath coming in oi itseli Tho
