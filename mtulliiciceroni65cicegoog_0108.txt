adlabertum cf. Gaius 11 101. All that was required, was tc name the heir
in presence of three or four witnesees (Plut. Coriol. c. 9). It was in use as
latre as nc. 143, for Vell Pat. 11 5menti0ns it as an incident ofa forlom attack
hy some soldiers under command of Metellus Numidicus, facientibus omuibus
iu procinctu testamenta, velutad certam mortem eundum foret. It is strange
that though O. here distinctly states that the custom was obsoleta iu hie
time, a statement not at all at varianae with the allusion to it in Orat. 1 228
(tamquam iu proeimtu testamentum suomet siue libra et tabulis), yet both
G. Long, in Dict. ofAnt, and T. Ο. Sandars, on Juetinian Iust. 11 10, quote
O. as witnessing that this form was still practised in his day. The case
mentioned hy Caesar B. G. 1 39 is quite distinct: through terror of
Ariovistus and his Germane culpo totis eastris testamenta obsignabamum
no obu'grnate'o was required in the form iu procinctu. Iu later times we read
of further relaxatione in regard to the military testament (Gaius 11109),
ex quo: ‘in consequence of which '3 es the auspices were no longer taken,
there was nc longer an opportunity for the eoldiers to make their wille. For
this uee of ea quosee Diu. 1' 65 euque et illud est Callani, Orat. 11 154 referta

pereum putant, where Wilkins cites Tusa. v 17 euque uec timor attinyat.

cum auspicia posuerunt: compare for this end what precedes, Diu. 11
76 bellimm rem administrari majores uestri, nusi auspicum, uoluerunt.
Quam multi aurii suut, eum bella a proconsulibus et a propraetoribus ad-
ministrantur, qui auspicia riou babent? Itaque nee amnes transeunt auspi-
cato 'nec tripudio auspicamur. Nam ea acuminibus quidem, quocl totum
auspicium militare est, jam M. Marcellus ille quinquies oomul totum omuit,
idem imperator, idem orequr optimus. The growth cf the empire had led,
as early ae nc. 327, to the practice cf sending out proconsule and pro-
praetore to the provinces, instead cf consuls and praetore, who alone had
the coeperim this practice was made law by Sulla’s Lea Cornelia ole pro-
uinciis nc. 81, and carried further by the Lea Pompeio ee. 52, which
required an interval of five years to elapse before an err-magistrate could
succeed to the charge of a province. On his entrance into office the consul
was said aempere ausperto, while in office babere aurp, cn hie resignation
ponere ausp, see Bouchb-Leclercq 1v 238 foll.

ξ 10. atvero: ‘but assuredly it was the contrary among cru an-
cestore; they did not neglect religion’. So in 111 87, Orat. 138, Art. v 11,
but in Diu. 1 51 it merely confirms what precedes by a stronger case.

imperatores: 11115 tu autem etiam Deciorum deuotionibus placatos
deos esse censes Itis doubtful whether two or three of this family devoted
themselves. The aelf-sacrifice of the father, P. Decius Mus, in the Latin
war 1³. c. 340 is attested by Livy (vm 9 where the rulee and ceremonies cf
deuotio are fully laid down) and Cic. Diu1 51, but questioned by Mommsen
