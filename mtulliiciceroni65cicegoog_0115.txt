before an argument to prove the authority of the horuspices. It is
impossible that C. could have meant it to stand where it does. Perhaps
the passage may have been rewritten and this sentence be a relic of the
earlier form. On O.'s idea of the importance of the augur, see Lep. 11 31
cited on N. D. 1 14.

quorum interpretes sunt: this argument, called the arc Stor'cormm in
Dio. 110,is given there in a slightly different form, ar'c reciprocantur m ef, si
divinatio art, eli sim, et ai di aiat, eit dioirmtio, to which O. retorta Dio. 11 41
meite est probabilius, ‘rma est eutem dimicatio, moa sam ergo di'. Not
unlike is the argument ridiculed in Lucian Jep. Troy. 51 εἰ γὰρ εἰσὶ βωμοί,
eici καί θεοί· ἀλλὰ μὴν rici βωμοί, είσίν ὅρα καί θεοί, to which the opponent
replies ἢν πρότερον γελάσω είς κόρον, ἀποκρινοῦμαί σοι, id. Hermai. 70 ‘most
arguments are based upon things which are disputed, and others on things
which have nothing to do with the matter, ὥσπερ εί τις οίοιτο ἀποδείξειν
civetate διότι βωμοί αὐτῶν ὄντες φαίνονται’. So Sext. Emp. 1x 132 εί μή
είσι θεοί, οὐδὲ μαντικὴ ὑπάρχει, ἐπιστήμη οὖσα θεωρητική καὶ ε’ξιιγητικι) τῶν
ὑπὸ θεῶν ἀνθρώποις διδομένων σημείων, οὐδὲ μὴν θεοληπτικὴ καί imperiorum),
οιί hoyensi, οὐχ ἡδί ὀνείρων πριίῤῥησιε1 ἄτοπον δι’ γε τοσοῦτο πλῆθος πραγμάτων
ἀναιρεῖν πεπιστευμένων ἤδη παρὰ πᾶσιν ἀνθρώποις· εἷσίν ἄρα θεοί. There
is a certain analogy between this and two Christian arguments, the one
from the nature of (iod inferring the antecedent probability of revela
tion: ‘if there be a wise and good sod, it is probable that he would
reveel something of his will to men'; the other from the fact of prophecy
inferring a divine Inspirer, ‘the prediction of particular future events
is beyond the power of man, but the life and death of Christ, and
the dispersion of the Jews, are particular events predicted by chish
propheta centurias before they came to pass, therefore these propheta were
gifted with a superhuman power'. Oioero's real belief in regard to divina-
tion is stated Lag. 11 aare· deos'eaae antecedimus ceramque amate mandem
rapiet eoadem homiaem consulere perrari ei posse aoth aigae reram fe-
- tererem ostendere, aea rideo cur esee divinationem crepam. Jam vero per·
mediorum exemplarem et mostra est pieria res pablr‘ca et ommia regma ...... ec
caparam praedictis malie incredibiliter vera cccidrhae. But though he accepts
these storias as proofs of the former reality of divination, he regards it now

as a lost art. The best statement of the Stoio argument is to be found
¹ Dio. 1 823 while maintaining thet it was inconsistent with the divine
goodness to hide the future from man, they denied that this involved any
departure from the established order of the universe: signs and portents
were the results of a pre-established harmony‚ Dio. 1 118 amplam Stoica
