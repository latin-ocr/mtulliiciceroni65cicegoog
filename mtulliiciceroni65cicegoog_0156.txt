Doederlein wished 16 keep the form pellucidae 161 this 161161 sense. We
know that some 61 the Pythagoreans conceived the sun and moon to be
ὑαλοειδῆ (Zeller 1 839) ; and Plut. (116616 Ort. 929 6) 161616 to those who
compared the substance 61 the moon 16 glass 61 crystal; Seneca (N. Q.

earth penetrated by a fiery atmosphere. Posidonius believed that the
moon received its light from the sun, and that owing 16 116 rarity it was
1161611661 by this light to a considerable depth (Cleom. 11 4 p. 106).
Anaxagoras and Democritus held the sun (some say the moon 6166)16 be
a red-hot mass 61 metal 61 stone. On the other hand we 616 told that
Xenophanes thought that the moon was inhabited (dead. 11 123).
