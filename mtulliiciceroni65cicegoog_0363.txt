book is sufficiently apparent from its title. He
has collected a great quantity of minute and
curious information about the working of Cam·
bridge institutions in the last century, with an
occasional eomparison of the corresponding
state of things at Oxford . . . To a great extent
it is nrely a book of reference, and as such it

knowledge of English education and learning.’'

volume it may be said that it is a genuine
service rendered to the study of University
history, and that the habits of thought of any
writer educated at either seat of learning in
the last century will, in many cases, be far
better understood aster a consideration of the
materials here collected''-Acadaemy.
