εεῦανδρος, but H. Nettleship in an interesting paper on the Earliest
Italian Literature (J. of Phil. x1 p. 180 foll.) prefers the older vievv, which
connects it with forv' and φωνή. He considers that the Fauni were the
scere of the early matio communities and that, as their functione were
superseded, they became unreal beings, speaking with unearthly voices in the

to Faunus any sudden alarin whether from an apparition or a voice.
