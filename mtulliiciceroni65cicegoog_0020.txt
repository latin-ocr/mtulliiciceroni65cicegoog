by 1110 elder Stoice 001111010ηο and unworthy the attention 01 0
philosopher. Like (licere, 110 contrasted the denser atmosphere 101-
mediately surrounding the earth with the fine ether, which filled the
upper regions 01 the universe (1 17), he described the inhabited world
as an island surrounded by the ocean (1 165), and, as 11010010 11010
Seneca, he paid particrdar attention to the plienomena of volcanos·
(196). Both Strabo and Galen refer to him as the chief writer on
the influence 01111001101010 01 0 country upon 1110 1000101 and 1110101
constitution 01 110 10101110010111 17, 42) ; and Galen tells us he
laid great stress on the use 01 (1101 101 controlling the irrational
0101110010 01 the mind (1 42). For here too Posidonius differed 11001
the older Stoics: he recognized 00 1110110001 01010001 10 man's
1101010, sostening down the broad demarcation drawn by Chrysippus
between the different kingdoms 01 nature, end adopted Aristotle's
view, that each higher 10001100 01 the soul involves the lower, 00 ,
that all the functione are found combined with rationality in man
(11 33, 34, 85); while certain plants make an approach towards
animal life (1 120), and animale towards human 1110 (1 29). Tha
rational seul is not only an emanation 11010 Deity (1 17), but it is
itsels eternal, not, as the older Stoics believed, doomcd to perish in
the chlical Conflagration (1 62). 011 the origin 01 civilization
(11001-011 view (11 148, 150) 10 10 complete accordance with what
Seneca tells us 01 Posidonius (ap. 92). Both rationalize the old
belief in a Golden Age(§ 159), and attribute the early inventions
01 mankind to philosophie lawgivers and kings. Even Cicero’s
patriotic eulogy 01 Roman piety is 001 without a parallel in Posi-
donius (§ ).

Igo on now to the 3rd point mentioned above, the admiration
shown 101 the writings 01 Ρ1010 and Aristotle. In my 001000132
Ι have pointed 0111 thet Oicero’s deas pbilosophorum, applied 10
’ the former, may be matched from tha fragments 01 Posidonius,
while itis quite opposed to 1110 language 01 the older Stoice. So
Aristotle is praised in 195 and 1 125 ; and the notes on 11 13, 17, 26 ·
(spontaneous generation), 33 (00010 01 existence), 34 (110100 01 higher

(001010, chance and freewill), 44 (voluntary 100νο010010101010),
