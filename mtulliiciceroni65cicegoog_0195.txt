nem cum vetus-opplevisset: the insertion of ααα, which might
easily be lost after narn, explains the oppleeiseet of the best nes, and gets
rid of the harsh asyndeton, involved in the reading adopted by Mn and
Soh. The latter abjecte (Opaca. 111 371) that the Stoice considered their
plyn'na ratio to be the original sense of the myths, and that it is mconeet
to represent this meaning as foisted into them by philosophers in recent
times. But we may understand the Latin as follows ‘whereas the general
belief throughout Greece was that Uranus was mutilated and Cronos
bound, the theory which was put into that eoarse form was far from
wanting in refinement'. [Perhaps rather ‘wanting in point ’. Eleganter
is a common word in Law Latin and generally used in this way, eg. eleg.
saibit ‘puts a nice point ', ‘reasons closely and neatly'. n]

Caelum: for the story see Hes. Theop. 159-182, and ior other inter-
pretatione Cornutus c. 7, Flenk pp. 44 fon, 62 foll, Lactantius 1 12.
Preller’s explanation (Gr. M. 1 45) is not unlike that given by Cornutus :
Crenas, the god of harvest (connected by him, as by Cornutus, with κραίνω,
‘to bring to perfection', hence Zeus Orouion ‘the son of Perfection’) puts
an end to the excessivo fecundity of Uranus, and thus allows the various
powers of earth and heaven to grow to maturity. He compares it with
other mytho in which heaven and earth are said to have been so closely
joined at first that there was scarcely room for the other gods to exist be-
tween them.
