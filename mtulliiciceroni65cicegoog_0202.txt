noorr 11 cn. xxvn ς 67. 177

ab eundo nomen: ie. ianus or eauus, es we read in Maerob. Sat. 19.11
laeuaeque ab caude dutum, quael muudus semper eat, alum ia orteia volatur
ι et ea se initium faciens, in ee refertur: uude et Oerapleiue Elysiorum libro
tertio, ‘ Oe'cero ’, iuquit ‘ uou Juuum secl Eanum eluminat ab euuolo’. This is
the etymology given by L. and·S.; I prefer the more common one sup·
ported by Preller and Buttmann, which regards it as another form of
Diaeta connected with Ζεύς and dees (see below on Diauu); but they seem
tc be mistaken in attributing this derivatico to Nigidius Figulus (ap.
Macroni. c.) pronuntiauit N. Apollinem esse Jauum Dianamque «lanam,
apposita elicitae qaue saepee' litterae cauea 0100001 apponetur, ut ‘ realiter'
...et similia. Jauum quedam solea deuwastruri uoluta, et ieleo geminum,
quusi utriusque januae caelestis potentem, qui aeuum aperiat dum, oeci?
deas claudat. Nigidius here distinctly says the d is otiose and added
merely for the sake of euphony, so that he may very well have concurred
with O.'s derivation. The chief objection to this latteristhat it would
make the original attribute of the deity simply to preside over doors, whereas
he is the old Latin god of the sky, styled alearum‘ aleus in the ancient
hymns of the Salii, end the learned augur Messala, who was consul 53 Β. a,
writes of Janus as the god qui cuneta fiopit eademque repit, aquae tarneque
eim ue emturum precem atque prauum ia profundum dilabentem, ipais atque
animae levem ia telmessum iu sublime sapientem, copulavit circumdate caelo
(Macrob. 1 c).

transitio: this appears to be the only instance oi the concrete use.

jani: ‘archways' cf. Suet. Dom. 13 janoe arcusque cum quadrigis eastraeit,
Oetae, 31 Pompeii statuam marmeno jauo superposuit ; especially used of the
Roman Exchange, the arcade with four arches in the forum, where merchants
used to meet. Jauue is distinguished from arcus by its length, from fania
as being essentially pervious. Preller thinks it was named from the god,
as symbolic of the vault of heaven ; but it seems better to regard it, with
Buttmann, as a periectly distinct word, derived (as O. says) from ire, and
merely associated with the god at first fram similarity of sound; after-
wards etymologists discovered such connecting links as we read in the
passages cited above from Macrobius.

in liminibus profanarum aedium: the janua was properly the front
door (actuum) of private houses, see Vitruv. v1 7, Serv⁸ Aea. 14493 not of

temples, for which uuluae is the regular term, see 2 Verr. 161, rv 94, 124,
p. Darae 121, Diu1 74, Caesar B. 0. 1053 Virgil however speaks of atri
janua Dum and Pliny (Ep. 11 17. 5110.) and Horace (Sat.116.112) use
taleae of folding doors in private houses.

nam Vestae nomen a Graecis: I think it is unnecessery tc change
uam into jam (as Ba). Nune implies that what follows is expected: and
here Oic. had already mentioned the beginning and the end as of prime
importance: he has finished with lanus, and introduces Vesta as pre·
siding over the end. ‘So much for J anus; as for Vesta she is a Greek
goddess'. On the elliptical use of uam in lists of names cf. n. 0n1 27,

n. e. 11. 12
