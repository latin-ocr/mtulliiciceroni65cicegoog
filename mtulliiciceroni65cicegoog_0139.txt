P, H.-1 14 ξ 40, Lucr. 11 871, v 797. The words stirpibus infixo are, I
’ think, equivalent to ἑτέροις Ιἐγγίνεται φυτοῖς in the passages quoted from
Arist, and refer to parasitic planis, such as the misdetoe, quod nort ιιια
seminet orbos (Aere. vr 206), and perhaps to fungous growths. Spontaneous
generation is probably mentioned as giving the strongest proof of the
generativa virtue of heat (calido sotis corscreto copore). For ipso see Roby

- ipse liquor aquae: ‘the very fact of the fluidity of water, inde·
, pendently of any other proof'. So in Lucr. 1454 liquor is said to be the
property of water, as heat of fire. The Mss generally read effrsio after
declarat, Probably this is a gloss to explain liquor. In a few mss the
textis altered to make it grammatical. Itis an objection to Madv.’s ,
emendation (ecfusio) that it creatas confusion by interposing a nonnos ,
the same gender between the relative and its antecedent. · primum:

pression, where pretim is Abl. of Conse, being used loosely of trost, and we ·
might at first sight be inclined to explain it similarly here, since frigoribus
must certainly denote a cause; but the addition oi rire seems to show
that we must take these ablatives to denote the manner of congelatior, as
probably in Virg. G. 11 376 frigeremur emacrete miro. [Swainson cites
