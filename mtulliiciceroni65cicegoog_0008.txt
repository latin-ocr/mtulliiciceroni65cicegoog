helpful to a scholar, but unfortunately it only comes
down to Eratosthenes ;» and Rudolf Wolf in his ex-

a limited space to the Astronorny of the Ancients. „
While I have been engaged in the study of the
scientific writings of the Old World, it has often ἢ
occurred to me to deplore the neglect into which they

Α have fallen amongst ourselves. The early guesses of

Greek science exhibit in a most interesting way the

development of the human mind, and they are so

· closely connected with the philosophy of their time,

that it is scarcely possible to form a right estimate of
the one without knowing something of the other. Why
might not Cambridge, which has now admitted into
her final classical school the Art, Philosophy, History
Α and Law of the Ancients, add to these also the Scienoe
of the Ancients as a new alternative subject? lt would
be easy to have examinatione in Mathematical' and
Biological Science in alternate years; and, if in one
year studente were asked to bring up for examination
‚specified treatises of such authors as Euclid, Archi-

medes Geminus and Ptolemy, and in another year
portione of Aristotle, Theoplnastus Pliny and Galen,

particularly the De Usu Porcium of the last, l think
it would not only call attention to some very excel-
lent and much neglected writings, but also provide
a useful link between our literary and our scientific
education.
