XX INTRODUCTION.

129, much os the section 011 anatomy ἕξ 134-146, show how largely
the author whom Cicero follows was influenced by Aristctle. No
doubt this is true generally of the Stoic school, but the views put
forward in some of the above-cited passages are opposed to those of
’ the older Stoica, and may with much probability be attributed to
Posidonius, of whom Strabo says (11 3 §8) πολὺ γάρ ἐστι vd αἶτιολογικὸν
παρ’ αὐτῷ καὶ ad ἅριστοτελίζον.

sse next point for consideration is whether we have any grounds
for supposing that the treatise of Posidonius, quoted in 1 123, would
deal with the same topice as Cicero’s similarly named work. Schwencke
(Jahrb. s elasa. Philol. 1877 pp. 129-140) points out that in ,
, general the Stoies treated the question of the Existence and Nature
of the Gods separately fnom that of the Providential Government
of the World. Thus the περὶ προνοίας cf Chrysippus is a distinet
. work from his περὶ θεῶν, and Diogenes Laertius mentions thern in
, different parts of his lth book, the former in c 138, the latter in c.
148. But of Posidonius, and of him alone, we are told that he
treated of both subjecte under the title of περὶ θεῶν (Diog. Le). His ·
treatise consisted of five books, in the lst of which he maintained
the divinity of the heaven and the universe, in the 3rd (so (lebet,
not l3th as in Hlibner's ed.) argued in favour of the providentia]
government of the world, while in the 5th he confuted the Epicurean
doctrine (N. D. 1 123). It seems not improbable therefore that, as
Schwencke suggests, the first four books of Posidonius may have

correspondcd with the quadrupla division with which Cicero com-
mences his second book.

One other slight indication of the author may be found in § 165,
where Rhodes is put on a level with Rome, Athens and Sparta, see
Mr Roby's note on the passage. As Panaetius was born at Rhodes,
while Posidonius resided there for the greater part of his life, this
might at first sight appear to be equally in favour of either author-
ship, but there can be little doubt that such an allusion is more
natural in the mouth of one who, like Posidonius, presided over the
University of Rhodes and took a leading part in its politica, than of
one who spent the active years of his life in Athens and in Rome
and never returned to his native land after he had once left it (Oic.
Taso. v 107).

Ι think that the various consideratiens adduced above leave little
doubt as to the Posidonian authorship of Cicero's treatise, but there
are some facts which appear to militate against this and which have
